## Steps to run the Prediction Test:

1. Download the "bundir_tes.py", dataset.csv, and datasets folder (which contains the models, tokenizer, and config)
2. Put the models, tokenizer, config, dataset.csv, and bundir_tes.py in the same directory.
3. Just run the code normally, and try inputing a sample message
