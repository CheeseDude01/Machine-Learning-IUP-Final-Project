237835," I am suffering from dysthymia and things feel like they are getting worse and worse.I hope this is the right place and i will try and keep this short. Since i have moved from Russia when i was 9 into France, then at 11 moved to England. This is when things really started to go downhill I have been isolated from the social groups in secondary school bullied severely, was always alone and ignored by teachers which really made me miss 3-4 years of my education. From that point i always felt sad and never really felt as happy as any of my peers, everyone always asked me ""why do i look so grumpy/sad all the time?"". However, it is this year that i have started to notice my emotions more and more, i see everything in a very negative monotone view, try keep away from speaking to people as much as possible, generally really hopeless and a very short attention span (usually when i start work in 5-10 minutes i will start playing video games for hours)  

This is concerning me a lot at the moment as i have taken on an International baccalaureate and at the moment i am getting a lot of work and my exams are just in 2 months and i just see no point in it at all, i will not do any work, i have no motivation at all i just want to lock myself away somewhere secret and never get out, because what is the real point of studying? because every time i try and overcome this i always comeback to the start where i was, i try and keep my self happy sleep well try and keep a healthy diet but again i comeback to that starting line again. 
So i am really despaired at the moment. 

I have went to see my general practitioner which then gave me a referral for counseling (which took 4 months) and then the counselor has diagnosed me after a long 3 hour interview and she has reached the conclusion that i suffer from dysthymia, she explained to me that she will give me an appointment to a psychiatric who will prescribe some anti-depressants and conduct cognitive therapy and that also is going to be only in 4 months. 

So i have waited so long in hope that someone will be able to improve my current conditions and now only two weeks to wait until the treatment is going to commence. I just want to know, how much will all the anti depressants and therapies will help me, because i don't want to go in there with all my hopes at maximum and then after do something stupid because it was not as i expected. For example will it help you form ideas clearly, better attention span, generally feeling happy, improve my self esteem, more sociable etc

Thank you so much for any responses!(hope this not too much of a brag and understandable text)

I don't know if this is the right place to post, but yeah can't think of anywhere else, so. 
First of all, i feel dumb for feeling suicidal in the first place.
And second of all i feel dumb for feeling suicidal because of my looks and because of how lonely i really am. 
I'm a weird looking guy. Even though i'm a nice and normally interesting guy, my looks gets in my way. Even my closest friends have called me ugly behind my back. Not so much i can do about it though.
It's just really hard to bear the emotional pain of being called ugly so often. It's really a battle each day.

I guess i got friends, but i feel like i have slowly drifted away from them. It seems like they grow happier each day with their girlfriends, and i just slip longer and longer into the dark. 
It's really weird to experience. They are growing up to be stable and jolly adults, and i'm just growing more and more gray and depressed. I haven't got much in common with them anymore. The only thing keeping me up with them is my fake smile and effort.

I'm just so tired of pretending everything is alright, and i feel weird thinking all of these thoughts. It seems like they are here to stay.

Just needed to get that off my chest.

Thanks.

And I've gotten so good at keeping quiet now. Suppressing everything. But it's still there. Pounding through my head. I take out the blender, and imagine turning it on with my head inside. Could I scramble up my brains with my hair? We brought a saw into the basement. But I think, if we ever set it up properly, I could cut my whole head off while he's away. The one thing keeping me here dialing through the days is a dog. A very broken dog I adopted. He hates that dog. I love that dog. Could that dog recover without me? Would he still be on a warm bed at night? That dog deserves everything. I deserve to be dead. Without me alive, I think this dog will also die. But then we could be together somewhere else maybe? I can't do that to him. The dog needs more time.
He likes to shoot guns in the backyard. I've warned him for years that I have issues and, given an easy enough chance, I'd hold that pistol to my head and hope I can hear my skull burst before I dive into the wonderful blissful blackness. He wants me to get my pistol permit. The plan is to get through just a few more years. Pay off debt. Get my permit. Assuming my last hospital stay is far enough in the past and won't be brought up. And then I have no guilt to be here. He'll be fine without me. He can take my car. Pay the bills. And I won't even have to use his gun. I'll have my own. I'll have legal permission to gush my own brains and blood into my backyard.
But every year feels like it's getting harder. I'm not even a human anymore. I'm a shell filled with regret. I want a do-over. And it would be so easy, to ask to learn how to shoot. He'd probably be so happy. And when he looks away, I only need a second. Is there enough reason to stick out a few more years? I feel so lost.

I try to reach out for help, but everyone thinks I am seeking attention. I can't go on feeling judged and unhappy. Here is some background.  

I have had mental health issues since sixth grade. I was always unhappy during middle school even if I didn't realize it. Regardless of therapy or hospital stays, the suicidal thoughts keep coming back. That leads me to my current situation. 

I have just started high school. I thought that I would be better this year. I was wrong. The first week I already had so much work. I was so overwhelmed. I was always able to stay on top of my grades but for some reason it felt like to much for me. I started to not go to school. I have already missed 8 days in one month. 

This problem comes with many others. My mom and dad haven't lived together in years. During the summer I went to stay with my dad to build our relationship. Every time he is around me it seems like he is forcing himself. When I get lonely I go to my mom's house. 

She is supportive but judgmental. If I make a mistake it turns into ridicule. I now have to chose where to live. My grandmother's house has people in it who spread rumors about me behind my back so that definitely isn't a option.

155763,"my first post.Hi. 

I’ve. wanted to kill myself since my 8th birthday. Let me start by saying I was a very anxious young child. I would freak out over any tiny occurrence. For example, If my parents where late getting me too a birthday party I would have a panic attack right outside, refusing to go in. By third grade, my panic attacks became a nightly problem.

I believe my depression/suicide and my anxiety aren’t as connected as my parents and doctors make it seem to be.  You see, my depression started in response to being bullied. I was constantly bullied about my size(weight, and height). I was left out and had no friends until 5th grade. 

5th grade was when all the boys and girls(i go to a coed school) started hanging out. It was only the coolest boys and girls though and back then only the fastest boys were the coolest, me being 5 2 and 200 lbs in 5th grade didn’t make me fast whatsoever. Although I wasn’t getting any attention from girls I started to make friends with the boys. Going into middle school I would say I had 4 real friends. 


Then in 6th grade, I met her. Let’s call her girl X. When she walked into the bus that first day, it was like looking at an angel. It being her first day at my school, she asked to sit next to me on the bus. That could’ve been the first thing a girl said to me that wasn’t a bullying comment. Anyway, I instantly fell in love. I sat with her everyday, and I quickly learned she was perfect. We had all of the same interests.  Throughout 6th grade It wasn’t that big of a deal to be friends with a girl anymore so i started talking to more people. 

We had the same math class. I would constantly make a fool out of my self to get her to notice me and nothing worked. On a side note I think I went all of 6th grade without hanging out with anyone outside of school. Ohh by the way I forgot when but towards the end of 6th grade I asked her out. I’m sure you can guess what she said.

In the beginning of 7th grade it was more of the same. All i wanted was for this girl to notice me for more then a friend and I got nothing. Although, I started making friends. I started going out and hanging out with more people inside and outside of school. My best friends bar mitzvah was in the middle of the year. 


During the cocktail hour I remember a different friend leaning over towards me and making a joke about this kids name who crashed. Being myself who just wanted to be noticed by people, I went and introduced myself to the two kids who crashed. I was very barney Stinson i’m going to teach you how to live about the whole thing even though they were both a grade older and much taller, skinner, better looking then me. The kid with the funny name told me he wanted to hook up with girl x. girl x was my best friend at this time. Trying to act all cool i introduced the two.

The ended up making out in the middle of the dance floor, in front of everyone. my hart was crushed. I ran out of the place crying got in a cab and went home. When i got home no one was there. I decided this is it this is the night when i do it. I’m dying myself. I followed everything I had previously planed out(which i think was actually inspired by a fellow poster). I climbed inside my hamper naked holding with nothing by a knife. I kid you not through all my crying I did not hear my parents come home and my dad caught my hand/knife on its way to impail my neck. 

I stayed friends with girl X up until she left the state at the end of the year. I tried to keep my distance to protect myself It was my first love for the first girl who showed me any attention and it didn’t work out. 

So 8th grade No girl X. I spent 8th grade in the gym. Working out everyday every week every month. Now i’m here at the end of 8th grade with all the weight lost feeling just as lossed as i felt exactly 1 and 1/2 years ago.

While it was a stupid thing to do, I don't feel like I did anything wrong. When it went to court, my lawyer advised me to plead guilty to disorderly conduct. Even though I didn't do anything wrong, I did what he said, and I got six months of probation.

The real problem was with work. I work in police dispatch, and the POST council could revoke my certification regardless of the court's decision. Today, almost a year later, I received a certified letter stating that my certification was revoked.

I’ve isolated myself hoping it’ll force me to not be so needy and just fix myself, but idek if it was such a good idea? The first 15 posts I’ve seen were on how investing the feeling of loneliness is. I feel like I feel too much, and I’m too aware of where I fall short. I just feel like a burden to people, and to everyone else, just insignificant. I feel like I do everything to fight this feeling too. Everything they say “should help”. I’ve been belligerently positive for a while, yet I’m still back here. Is this what I should expect for the rest of my life ? ",depression

I've been dreaming of the moment I can take my life along with all of the shit I had to and still am dealing with. I've given up on trying to find something worth living for. I've been thinking about it a lot the last couple of years and the way I see it is you should only live if you want to live, if you find something that you percieve as being worth all the trouble that comes with just being alive. People that tell you to live and then fuck off are the most selfish people in the world. Apparently it's selfish to put yourself out of your missery when you have no escape but it isn't selfish to force someone to struggle every day so you can feel good about yourself.

i've finally decided i needed to go to a mental hospital-- which might sound great in theory, but as a person with anxiety that knows that both of their parents have anxiety and worry about me a lot, i just worry about how they'll react. both of them will be worried-- which i don't want them to. even if i tell them that it's okay, i *know* they'll be worried about me.

i don't want them to be worried. not at all. i know i have to do this for myself but they're one of the few people who legitimately care about me. the only other people are on places like this.

another problem is my lack of motivation to do anything. i don't know why but my will to live had dropped significantly over the past few months. i don't even go outside anymore. i don't have any motivation to go and do things that provide a better environment, and i don't even know why.

i feel hopeless, and on several occasions, i've imagined an entire plan of how i'd kill myself. i know how people would react. me and my struggles would be forgotten in less time than people erased me from their minds ever since middle school. i've never existed since then to anybody at all

340751,"I made a list**Reasons not to kill myself**

&gt;My existence improves the lives of family, friends and acquaintances --- even if the improvement is subtle.

&gt; No parent should have to bury their child.

My suicide would cause these people grief. This is the main factor holding me back. On the other hand, this is my life and the feelings of others shouldn't necessarily deter me from ending it given the magnitude of suffering. I won't care about the feelings of those I've been close to after I'm dead.

&gt;The Little Things in Life (TM).

The decision of whether or not to live really comes down to whether or not the sum of my experiences (not the right word, really, but I can't think of the proper substitute) is positive. Sources of small happiness count toward this, too. 

    life.big_things + life.little_things &gt;= 0    

&gt;It's still possible that my net happiness will eventually outweigh my net suffering.

Counterargument to the above. Waiting to see if this turns out to be the case would be the most rational option. I would have plenty of time to experience nothingness after my natural lifespan has expired. However, given the treatment-resistant nature of my depression and anxiety, as well as my family history, it seems unlikely that I'll ever fully recover. 

&gt;I haven't yet listened to all of the music/seen all of the films/read all of the books that I would like to.

On to the section of the list where I rattle off things that I haven't done yet. Of course, these could all be negated by the argument that I won't give a shit after I die.

&gt; I've never created a satisfactory work of art.

Attempts tend to result in frustration rather than catharsis.

&gt; I haven't tried all of the drugs that I'm interested in.

Feel free to judge me. It's kind of sad that this one is on the list, in retrospect.

&gt; I have never been in a romantic relationship lasting longer than a week.

&gt; I have never had sex.

These are, depending on who you ask, major parts of life that I would be missing out on.

&gt; I have never been in a band.

&gt; I haven't fully explored my gender identity yet.

&gt; Though I'm no longer in class, I haven't yet technically graduated from high school.

&gt; It's still possible that a college I would like to attend will accept me.

&gt; I have not had the ""college experience"".

&gt; I have never traveled the world.

&gt; I have not satisfied my desire for knowledge.

&gt; They're making a third season of Twin Peaks.

Again, I can dismiss all of these easily.



**Bonus**

&gt; People will think I've done it over something trivial.

My recent rejection from my top choice college. Or Valentine's Day, which I don't even care about. I won't care what people think if I'm dead, though, so this doesn't really matter.

At this point I'm leaning towards doing it.",depression

i have a lot of people in my life who love me and want to be close to me. but i feel cold saying that i am either too overwhelmed by them or i don't feel close to them.   


my life pretty much changed for the worst when my long-term boyfriend and i broke up two years ago. the relationship was very traumatic for me for a lot of reasons.   


i spent the relationship taking care of him and his situation, which i do not regret - but i compartmentalized all of the trauma that i received. i never took care of myself, and now its hitting me. 

&amp;#x200B;

i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me. 

  
closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy. 

i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again.

 i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it.

132141,"can't even think of a non cheesy-sounding title.i am so tired of being lonely, of the few people i know only acknowledging my existence when they're in need, of nobody caring. i'm 20, male. apologies for the probably weird grammar, not my native language, really. just typing thoughts as they appear.

thinking about me writing this, my life hasn't been so bad, if not for my inability to be social. i don't know who to blame, maybe it's me.  i guess because I think of suicide you can call me.. shit forgot the word, but its someone who cares only about myself and not about others. you know, the whole ""but if you take your own life think about your parents!!!! your friends!!!! fucking whoever the hell else!!!!"" sure. okay. if they ever thought about me, asked me how i feel.
well my parents do care, I guess. but i've been trying to make them realize how serious it is, they don't seem to fully believe it. yeah my parents' life will be probably ruined, i can't even imagine what would happen to them. i'd probably feel a lot of regret (if i was alive). i'm already feeling bad for imagining what would happen to them.

friends? i don't have any. well yeah i know some people, but none i can call a ""friend"". at most, a dude with whom i had more fun that with others.my parents who divorced in 2000 and it stopped affecting me only in the recent 5-7 years. 
maybe it's school. you know, thinking about this, my school wasn't so bad. i've heard stories of people bullying someone so much that he tried to kill himself. i didn't have any of that, but i had been bullied a little, yeah. i think i got myself to blame for that. i was chubby, wore glasses (i still do), didn't care about how i look, stuff like that. i honestly don't know why everyone instantly knew ""woo puberty! i have to look good now or else i will be considered weird by other people"" and why I didn't care.
years have passed, I didn't care much about people stopping inviting me to parties and stuff, I just moved on further. then I got accepted into uni. I thought ""finally! now i can start from scratch and make proper friends"". i even changed how i look, lost almost all the weight, got a proper haircut, nicer clothes, etc. 

not so bad right, well what happened? people i met usually just spent time with their school friends. i was always like ""hey lets go somewhere"" or ""hey lets make a party"" and people were usually ""nah dude i'm busy with my other friends"". i wish i was that busy as well. i wish i didn't spent all fucking weekends on my pc or at home in general. but that's all i do, simply because there's no other choice. asking people to go to the movies is cool, i did that. asking people to go to the movies or something similar each and every fucking week is weird and off putting. can't do that. social acceptance. bunch of crap. 
but all of that was kind of acceptable, until during the second year i realized that i like a girl from my class more than usual. we were kind of friends, talked about stuff sometimes, helped each other with uni. then i realized that i want to know her more, and also that i don't fucking know how to do that. i tried asking her out. at first he understood it as ""hey lets go somewhere and bring all of our friends!"" and so she did. was cool, however absolutely fucking not what i wanted. i tried asking her again, that time she cancelled it because of unimportant reasons. so I thought, okay. i'll probably meet someone else even better, it's probably just my hormones fucking me up, you know, me being a virgin, and so on. so okay I thought, she's not interested in relationship with me, i'll just try to become a good friend of hers. and that's where it all went downhill. 

i don't know, maybe i'm wrong and im seeing things, but i started to notice that she cares about me much less than about the others in my class, if at all. you know, the whole playful stuff? none of that. I ask something, remind her of my existence, i get a simple answer and rarely a smile or anything. while she usually chatted with others every day, they laughed, etc. 
that went on for about a year. I kept noticing but I still wanted to be her friend (and since she always called me a friend, I thought so did she). until a recent ski resort trip in december. i knew she liked snowboarding, so once I saw on her FB that she and some of my other friends from class went there I became angry as shit. i was fucking furious. in the past i let her (and others) know that i wanted to try snowboarding real bad, so I was annoyed that they didn't even think about inviting me. ofc I didn't say that to her, but I did say that to our mutual friend. so next time (about two weeks later) he invited me as well, but he couldn't go so I thought ""finally! some time with her not in uni"". haha, silly me, she didn't say anything and brought an old friend of her. he's a chill dude, but she didn't shut up with him all the trip. i felt like a fifth wheel the whole time. or more like a 1034895th wheel.
and those kinds of situations started to happen more and more often. i started to become real jealous of her attention, I wanted, craved it. but i could not say that to her (again, social acceptance) until start of february, when we planned something before uni began once again, but because of some people she cancelled it and just dropped it on me. like ""so X and Y couldn't go so next time"". I realized that this is my chance to make her feel a little guilty, just to talk with her about the whole situation. so I made myself look real pissed and betrayed, and left.
that worked. she tried to call me several times, then messaged me on FB. we talked for a while. I asked her something along the lines of ""do I annoy you? just be honest, and if that so just tell me to piss off and I will. but don't call me a friend then.""
she said no, i'm great, etc. I believed her. but the situation didn't change. she still seemed to care about me less than about others. 
meanwhile it got even worse for me, the jealousy. if she posted photos about her going somewhere with her friends, or just played a coop game in Steam (I have her added) I would get jealous as hell, and as a result, angry, then depressed.
and it was today when I had enough and just left uni in the middle of a lecture. she sat near me, I thought, hey, lets talk about stuff. then I realized she sat by another dude actually(a new friend of hers) and she talked with him non stop, laughed, etc, etc. I nearly snapped my cellphone while I listened to that. i could bear it anymore so I just left. 

but you know what's the funny thing? she's actually a nice person. she even hugged me once, and said not to worry, after we both failed an exam. its just me being fucked in the head, the whole enlarged jealousy from out of nowhere, general sense of loneliness and ofc inability to talk to her about this stuff (last thing I want is her thinking that i'm weird. got enough of that in school. no thank you. and I already gave her a lot of grounds to think so)

i did calm down after typing all of this, but i know, that it would continue until we get out of uni, and after that, total fucking loneliness (im studying to become an electrical engineer, not the most social job y'know?). i don't want that. i don't want any more reasons for her and others to think im weird. but i can not contain myself anymore either.

there's way more stuff and reasons to mention but my fingers kinda hurt from all the typing.

also wow, the subreddit's pretty crowded. that's sad, really.

But in thinking about this, I wonder, especially since most suicides happen because of isolation and misunderstandings, what would happen if these people could meet others feeling the same way.

This would invalidate one reason, and could help clarify the other.  

So you are thinking, here's a bunch of depressed twentysomethings, a few teen anorexics, and some old middle aged curmudgeons, and they are all gonna meet up and have a smile fest? No, but maybe they could share their issues, vent their minds and maybe, make a friend; albeit one with issues, but aren't we all people with ""issues""?

Personally,  FWIW, my problem is I am isolated. I messed up as a youngster doing life on my own, no real family, been through 3 marriages, had the ""big life"", and more.  I had much fun and some strange, sensual times; ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe..."". But, now, nearing 50, I am long-term unemployed, overqualified, too old, undermotivated, sexually uninterested, tired and frustrated. I am living in Podunk with an old friend who's grown beyond tired of my presence; the tension here is tangible... Yea. I need an Obi Wan for hope, or some people to jumpstart me into living again. Some have told me I am arrogant; maybe so. Others said I am not desperate enough to clean port-a-potties for a living; quite possibly. But I just am sick and tired of all this, this life we call living, and really would rather disappear then to have to start all over again at the absolute bottom. I may try to move to a ""big city"" where the jobs and people are but I only have enough left in savings for about 2 months - then I have zero.  Can I get a job that pays more than $10 bucks an hour in 60 days?  Even the old communal living of share, sweat and serve seems appealing, but very few are managed by people with true communal intentions. Most or are narrow focused (let's put on our tinfoil hats and watch for the MIB) or are religious based; I don't believe in any god.

But regardless, what if a bunch of folks pooled resources, ideas and time and used that as a ""carrot on a stick"" for a future.  Maybe one knows something that could help another, maybe one can fix cars, or computers. Maybe one just needs a shoulder to cry on and they'll be OK. Yes, some may still not be able to resolve their issues, but this is at least a ""last chance at their life...""

8496,"new here. older (35f) and ready for death.i have seen many posts over the years, outdating reddit, outdating social media, that talked about suicide in your 30s. As a younger person, I think I was trying to outlast the tumultuous emotions, and I did. The sad fact now though, is that the up and down has turned into a constant down. I start to think that the attention I paid as a younger woman, to the women killing themselves in their 30s made me just more prone to it. I'm totally there. I can't stop doing the things I know are bad for me. I fall in love with men 5,500 miles away from me. I keep toying with the guy who only texts me every 6 months just to see what kind of BS he'll come up with, only to have him ""dump"" me for another girl over the very limited contact we had already.

128200,"Why are girls so hard to understand? So there is this girl that I've had a crush for quite some time. the moment I met her I realized that I was really into her. Every time we met up I also thought that she could be into me because I started noticing some signs that could mean that but it's turned out that I was wrong.

One day, about a good month ago, we went to my friend's place and had a bit of a party, were drinking, dancing, singing and just having a good time. Then most of us went to the balcony to have a smoke and after everyone left it was just me and my crush in the balcony. We talked about lots of different things for like a half an hour or maybe more and, in the end of the conversation, she told me that she knows that I'm into her but she doesn't see me that way and kind of rejected me, told me that she wants to stay friends with me because she likes me as a friend. I respected that she told me this in a quite nice way, although I was a bit to a heartbroken it wasn't really hard to get over it.

After that we kept on chatting, sometimes we met up with our friends, we hung out just the two of us, but it was just friendly things I guess. Now, a few days ago, I invited her and a couple other friends to my place for, if I can call it that, a party. We were doing the usual, drinking, dancing, singing, talking about loads of things. But then, after a few hours, my friend had to go home and I was left with my crush and another friend. We were all pretty drunk and my friend told my crush that she owes me a kiss on the cheek for helping with her school work, so she gave me a kiss on the cheek and then a couple more. Then, I don't know how, it escalated to me and my crush kissing on the lips twice or maybe even more. Those weren't French kisses, but they still were like 10 or so seconds. After that, she had to go home, so I walked her to the taxi and give her a kiss and a hug and went back to my home. When I get home, my friend congratulated me for kissing her, she was genuinely happy for me, I also was bit hyped and proud of myself I guess.

The next day I and my crush chatted for a bit, but nothing unusual. The following day was the Valentine's Day, so after spending half of the day by myself, I decided to invite my crush to my place. But she rejected the offer and told me that she's spending it with someone else.

That got me really confused. Before the party, I saw her as just a friend, but after the party she kind of messed with my head and my heart once again.

Like, if kissing a person doesn't mean that you're into them, what on Earth does? Maybe she lied about spending the Valentine's Day with someone just to mess with me, or am I a bit too optimistic? I really don't know what to do with this situation.",non-depression
6160,"The only thing keeping me from killing myself...For a while now, I have had some suicidal thoughts. There are days when I'm fine, but then there are days when I have this horrible feeling in my chest. I've never really felt this way, but I guess something must have triggered it. I'm a working college student who is taking a pretty heavy coarse load, and have been for quite some time. I used to be full on hope and optimism, but it seems like I've made a complete 180. I don't have very many friends. I have like one or two ""close"" friends that I feel very comfortable with. Neither of these friends attend my university, and they live pretty far away, so we see each other very rarely. I have like two more friends that do attend my college, but I only see them in class, and even then we only talk about things regarding the class we're in. It's extremely hard making friends in college when you are a commuting student, and work a job. This makes it nearly impossible to join any clubs that have meetings during my free time. The clubs that do meet during my free times are extremely inconvenient because it takes about an hour to get to campus from either where I live or work. I used to be fine with not having any friends at school. I've gone a couple of semesters bring just fine with being alone on campus. I go to lecture, then go to the library to study and finish up homework before my next lecture starts. It's pretty safe to say that I've made no new real friends since college. I thought that when I started feeling like this, I just needed to meet new people. I tried extremely hard and actually met a few more people in class, but I still feel like this. I still have this feeling of dread in my chest.

I think that it's the stress of life. I'm scared shitless that going to school is meaningless because when I graduate I may not get a job and be stuck with the mountain of student loans I've accumulated. My parents make too much money for me to qualify for any financial aid, yet they have too many expenses to pay for my education, so I've had to take out loans. I just feel like I'm wasting away what everyone says are supposed to be the best years of my life feeling like crap. I'm afraid I won't get a stable, good paying job and put myself and my family in financial ruin. I'm afraid I will never be able to shake off this horrible feeling. I just want to be that optimistic kid I used to be a couple of months ago. That's really all I want, but I'm afraid he doesn't exist anymore and has instead been replaced with this scared, lonely, stressed individual who craves death.

I swear, the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my immediately family. If I were to kill myself, my two good friends would probably be said but shake it off pretty quick. My other ""friends"" would probably never even know. My family is what really worries me. My parents have taken out loans under their name to finance my education on the condition that I pay them once I graduate and find a job. They have sacrificed so much to ensure my brother and I have a comfortable life. We have had some problems in the past, but they have worked so hard to try an make us a ""happy"" family. My parents have busted their asses since they were teenagers to have what we have today, and they constantly push me to try harder because they say they want me to be better off then they are, and hopefully I can teach the same to my children some day. I could not imagine the pain and agony they would go through if I were to kill myself, because I know I would feel the same way if any one of them were to pass away. My parents have grieved enough for multiple life times for loved ones lost throughout the years, and I don't want to put them through that pain. If I didn't have my family, I would have most likely killed myself a while back. I'm afraid that I have a finite amount of time left before my fears of failure become realized and I put a gun to my head. I feel like these feelings will consume me and surpass the love I have for my family and push me to take my life. 

I scheduled an initial consultation for therapy at my university (which is dirt cheap), but it's two week away. I hope I get better.

Also, English isn't my first language, so please bear with me.

So, well. Reading the title may make you think this isn't a big deal. But read the complete post before thinking that.
 
I am an introvert and have very bad social skills. I was a loner in high school, and had no friends in school. I wanted to have friends, have that ""normalcy"" that comes from being a teenager. But none of that happened. I was an outcast because of my scary looks and my general bad social skills. Then, in 7th grade, I met my first ever friend. We'll call them Ray.

Ray was exactly like me, had minimal social skills and was an introvert as well. But we instantly hit it off as we both played Minecraft on survival servers ( this was 2013 ). By talking to Ray and hanging over his house, I was able to improve my social skills slowly but surely, talking to his parents and him. I started making other friends, though not as close as I and Ray are. 

In 11th grade, depression hit me. I don't know if it was caused by my countrys shitty education system, or further bullying, or cram school, or all of the above. But I do know that depression hit bad. However, Ray was there to help me through that.
 He told me he did nothing, but I seriously cannot thank him enough for just being my friend during those times.

This year has been the worst year of a lot of peoples lives, but the icing on the cake was that today Ray told me that his dad got transferred. I was already quite depressed but this put me down even more. 

Even though I know we'll try, I know for a fact I'll never see him again. We're both going to different universities and are going to be trying to get into universities in different countries.

I just feel sad and worse than ever before. I know we can still keep in touch, but we'll not be as close as we were before. I have effectively lost my only friend.

We live in different cities, but we manage to see each other 2\-3 times during weekdays and we spend the entire weekend together. I try to take her to the movies, or to some restaurant every now and then, but almost always she says she's not in the mood. We stay home and watch something on Netflix, eat popcorn and talk for hours, and it's always an awesome day when I get to spend it with her. 

Her father died when she was 2yo, her mother neglected and left her to live with her grandparents for over 10 years. She has a younger sister, who she raised since she was 7. She had problems with past relationships and with her own family involving physical violence, but luckly not sexual. As far as I know, she used to cut herself for years before we met and tried to kill herself a couple of times. 

Her Grandfather, who raised her and who she loved more than anything died a few months before we met, and she cries every week and talks about how much she misses him, and how much he meant to her. Without him, she feels alone in a family that hates her. She always says that she is alone, and when I question her about if she feels alone with me, the answer is always the same. ""It doens't include you."" I started to feel like it does several months ago. 

Her jobs requires her to be up and ready at 4h30 AM, talk to hundreds of angry strangers for hours and work at crazy hours on weekends.

300484,"I just wanna tell everybody I’m gonna kill myself soon.My home life has always been super stressful.

I had a dream last night that my parents got in a fight, and my dad started hitting my mom over and over and over until finally she died. She wasn’t bleeding or anything, but was dead and it was so scary, it was the most real dream and I can hardly even see my screen rn with all my tears. Last week was the only week in months that was good. I went to school every day, parents didn’t fight, and got good grades. After having that dream I woke up just feeling super terrible. To sum it up, my mom always flips out on me (she goes insane) and then I end up flipping out and then I absolutely can’t go to school bc I’m a mess. Today it felt different though. I ran to the bathroom and I felt like I was going to be killed (my parents are both great people they wouldn’t kill me). My mom was talking to me outside the bathroom door and I remember leaning a little bc I genuinely felt for a second she had a gun to the door and was gonna shoot me if I said I wasn’t coming out.

I was in my bathroom basement where it is very “undone”. It has no shower, just a toilet in a tiny room with cinder block walls and a sliding wooden door. I looked around and could imagine me chopped up on the floor dead or something.

I ended up sleeping after my mom finally stopped going absolutely insane on me and then my dad. I would like to add, I usually never freak out until she does. I had full intentions on going to school, but then she made stuff so much worse by going insane on me.

I’ve always had “suicide thoughts” but I think everybody sometimes thinks to themselves “god I would rather be dead rn” but that always goes away and they would never kill themselves. Today, once my mom left I went up in my room and made it as dark as I could to relax. 

I started thinking, “if I killed myself an hour ago, by now it would be done, I would be gone, I wouldn’t even feel the pain anymore”. This way of looking at death is a way I can look at it where I could be alright with killing myself. The whole time I’m dying, even if it’s painful, I can just keep telling myself “it’s almost done it’s almost done” and it will be.

I remember laying down telling God “If you let me die rn when I sleep I won’t mind” and looking back, if I died a few hours ago, no, I don’t mind.

I don’t think I’ll kill myself today or maybe even soon. But I could any time I want now. 

Tomorrow is my birthday and it’ll also be a Snow Day. I won’t have my phone or anything, so I can’t make plans with any friends. With that said, I’m planning on waking up, laying on my floor, not eating, going to my weekly Wednesday therapy appointment, and then just continue to lay down.

210461,"Suicidal when drunkLately I've been drinking a bit more than usual. A mix of Christmas and also having brewed a big batch of beer, which enables me to drink more than usual since I live in a country where alcohol isn't sold in stores after 6 o'clock, which means I have ready access to alcohol when I would not usually.

And I'm getting reacquainted with that terrible old feeling of always feeling like killing myself after I've drunk a lot. Is this normal? I just get this feeling of not giving a damn about anything and throwing myself into trouble. I'm not suicidal when I'm sober but this is starting to worry me. I had a patch like this a few years ago when I would regularly try to kill myself while drunk using plastic bags that I'd put over my head when going to sleep. It was a dark time and I don't want to go back there. Any advice? I'm a bit lost about what to do or who to go to. I guess the rational thing to do would be to stop drinking. If so, tell me and hopefully I'll listen to you guys.",depression

180350,"I hate myselfI always ruin everything. I'm annoying, overly sensitive, judgy, and I always slur my words and don't take social cues. I only care about small things and cry easily. I'm a fucking liar. I've done so many shitty things and I feel the only way moving forward is to kill myself. The only thing keeping me from doing so is the embarrassment involved in people finding my body and how my family would react. I'm so tired and I don't have the energy to socialize anymore. I hate my friends because they make me feel bad about my body and overall person, but I don't have anyone else. I feel so fucking isolated and alone and I just can't go through this again I just can't. I'm so tired and so burnt out and although I know I can't kill myself, i want to. So much. My problems are nothing compared to others yet I still feel entitled to it being addressed as such. I wish a car would just hit me already. I don't understand socializing and I'm a burden to everyone around me. I always cancel plans last minute because I get so fucking anxious about it for no reason other than fear of embarrassment or failure, but the more I avoid it, the worse at socializing i become. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel so trapped and alone. I want to die already. It just feels like I'm trudging along day by day and I'm so tired of living like this. Just trying to reach the end of the day just for it to start all over again. I have no good qualities and I don't get why anyone likes me. ",depression

95121,"I hate my life. There's no point to it anymore.The option of suicide keeps crossing my mind lately. I hate it so much but I honestly don't see a downside to it at this point. Nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody's life would change at all if i were just suddenly gone. Not one single person would even notice if I were suddenly gone. None of my ""friends"" will even talk to me anymore and I honestly have no clue why. Not like I've done something to piss off any of them. I end up sitting alone in my bedroom alone day after day, trying to get some of my ""friends"" to hang out with me, even just for a little bit. I end up just sitting around, alone and forgotten. It's like some vicious circle. Being alone and forgotten makes me more depressed, yet being depressed makes people ignore you. Until you decide that living a life of depression isn't worth it anymore and you take the most obvious way out. Then, of course, everybody talks about how that person was such a good friend, and how great a person they were, even if they didn't fucking know the lonely bastard. Seen it happen so many times already in my short life.

I'm so tired of feeling like i'm fighting for my sanity constantly. I don't really even want to commit suicide. I just want this loneliness, this emptiness, to go away. I so desperately need a shoulder to cry on, but those closest to me have turned their backs on me. I don't even know what the fuck to do anymore. Nothing excites me anymore. I have nothing to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. I feel like I have reason to live anymore.",depression

I'm 36 and I've been following this subreddit for quite some time now. Mainly because I feel like a loser and a fake (in my own mind) and I've been thinking about ending it myself as long as I can remember. Suicide was always plan B.

I used to think that there was a connection between material possessions and happiness, but recently it occured to me: I was depressed and suicidal, when I made more than $100000 a year and I was depressed and suicidal, when I was in debt over my head as I am right now. Just one hour ago someone called me to ask me about some bill I didn't pay... This time it didn't really affect me that much.. Why?

So.. One morning, two weeks ago, I woke up actually shaking from anxiety and really out of my mind depressed - worse than I have probably ever felt. 

For the first time in many years, I went into the woods, it was raining heavily and I was actually scouting for a quiet place where I could lay undiscovered for a couple of days or more, but I don't know what happened. I was soaked, mud on my shoes, the green trees and the wind in my face. A deer suddenly crossed my path 10 meters in front of me and I saw a black snake of some kind crawling away to safety as I was walking along, once in a while a tiny small frog in the grass tried to dodge my feet. When I was in the army, I came to love nature even though it's a rough place and it doesn't really love you back. In that moment I just realized that I just love everything out there - a great big hurricane, howling winds, rain so thick you can't see, the force of it all just fills me with awe.. It all came back to me on that particular day - maybe because of my state of mind..

I still don't know what really happened and how my mind shifted so suddenly, but I had this overwhelming feeling that I had to go back and try again. I got out all the job application rejections I had received during the last months and replied to them. One in particular was an application from which I didn't even get a proper reply, so with my renewed energy on this particular day, I decided to write to the CEO of that company to explain my credentials and why they should consider hiring me.. I got an reply after a day or so and they wanted to see me after all - I had the jobinterview 6 hours ago and it went pretty good, but even if I don't get the job I'm probably going to do okay.

I still have very negative thoughts once in a while, but I really try to ignore them and push them in the background. I spend at least one hour in the woods every day now and I even bought a book to help me identify the plants and the herbs I might find out there and it seems to help me - far away from everything. If I lose my apartment or my car, then so be it. It doesn't re4ally matter to me right now. They are just things and they are not important right now.

Maybe that job I interviewed for will turn out okay or it won't. I hope it will - hence cross your fingers.. And maybe I'll descend into depression again - I don't know - but for the first time in years after spending 12-14 hours behind a computer every day, I think I have found the core of what really matters to me. It's not a specific thing - I just have this feeling again that I belong here in this world and that I need to mobilize a different plan B.

UPDATE: Everybody! I got the job!!! ... Actually they called while the real estate agent was having a look at my appartment.. Life is funny sometimes.. Best job ever - I get to continue the research I did in my own company the last 18 months, so it's perfect.. I won't earn that much as it is a small startup, but who cares.. I love you all! thanks!

Plan B will be different from now on - I hope.. :) ..

Not eating and chain smoking. 

Dirty ass and I am usually very clean

Been taking meds

That bitch of an ex is the sore

I wish I could say I hate her but I don’t hate people, but their ways.

She put me in a place bad. Said she was leaving and the next morning did just that. 
8 hrs later a PFA and 3 cops kick me out and said they were told I had a gun. No gun!
NO abuse...that motherfucker just lied. 

I saved that bitches life 2 times and now I have paperwork saying I abuse her? WTF?
She woke up with a stroke, I took her to emergency and rehabbed her
She had pneumonia, me again

In a hotel, no sleep, not eating, sad and hurt like hell. Confused lost and very weak.
Even after seeing my doctor and getting a script, nothing changes reality. 

I am not strong nor have any fight. It is not anyone’s job to fight for me. A support system to assist me would be grand but in
The cards. 

If you have severe reoccurring major depression and social anxiety with suicidal thoughts at peak, we are kin. 
You know heavy, dark moments that to pee is a chore. That is me..

I am tired of the fight, don’t wanna.  Who would know I am missing or care for more just a curiosity. Sad;...fucking pathetic..

35900,"I really want to give up (Sorry it’s lengthy and confusing. I have no where else to go to let this out)I’m a 20 year old college student and a single mom. I am fortunate enough to have a good amount of family supporting me and the baby. Despite this, I’ve been severely insecure and depressed for a while. I lack the social skills to make more friends. I’m always stuck at home with no car (I got in an accident last yr). I can’t work (my parents want me to just stick to school). I’m left completely dependent on my family. I planned on leaving this Earth last year after giving birth to my daughter. I got help. I was put into therapy, group,  more therapy, etc. Fast forward a year later and no improvements. I exercise, try to eat right, meditate, read, journal, watch/listen to a lot of self help videos and podcasts, say affirmations, pray, talked to friends... Nothing. It upsets me that I didn’t off myself sooner because everyone kept telling me to fight because “I’m strong” and “ You have a baby”. I’m always going to be attached to my daughter but that doesn’t mean I’m good for her. I don’t want her to grow up and see me upset and suffering—my behavior can rub off on her. I can’t always vent to my friends because they have their own shit. That usually leads me to venting to my ex/baby daddy. And it makes me feel like I’m at a severely low point. I hate how I’m left being vulnerable to the person that couldn’t love me back. Meanwhile, he’s not probably on to the next girl and enjoying life with friends.  It feels like everyone’s got a good grasp on life. My ex can move on and continue to be young while I’m left with a child, a broken heart, and way too much responsibility. I know I put this on myself. And I hate myself for it. And I feel so bad for my kid because she deserves so much more. The truth is I’m weak. I feel like I already fulfilled my purpose in life which was to deliver my daughter who already brings joy to everyone. I’ve been forgotten. It’s my time to go. I know that her grandparents can give her a more stable upbringing. And I’m sure that me leaving will force her father to step up. I’m going to jump off a cliff or an overpass of some sort, I haven’t reached a final decision yet. ",depression

Stop putting girls on a pedestal. They're not necessary to enjoy happiness. YOU'RE necessary to enjoy yourself, a girl isn't gonna do that for you.

1049,"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. 
I'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. 
I'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.

So I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. 
I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed. He works long tomorrow. 
I really don't think I can't make it another day.",depression
274280,"End of my ropeI'm literally sitting here staring at the rope, already knotted to where I would go unconscious before I would suffocate, and wanting to just be done with it all. I've been chronically sick the last few months that has left me in pain despite being in and out of the hospital over it, my dead end job where I'm working a job a couple pay grades above me without the actual pay, and just tonight my husband of 2 years decided he hated me over the fact I have to sleep more lately from the illness so I can work which means I don't always wake up for our little girl when she wakes up in the middle of the night.

I'm done with my chest always feeling like its on fire or being slowly stabbed. I'm done with having no respect at my job. And I don't want to even feel the pain of the man I love so deeply hating me for something I can't control.

edit: because of you guys, I was able to put my rope away and go to bed so I could get up a couple hours later for work. while nothing changed at work, Hubby and I were able to work something out so I wouldn't end up like I did last night.",depression

327565,"My friend just told me that she wants to kill herselfHi I don’t know where to begin but I guess the title gives it away: my friend just told me and two other friends that she wants to kill herself sooner or later. I‘m not 100 percent sure if it’s alright if I post this in here but it’s urgent and I don’t know what to do. 

Sorry if the format is weird, I’m on my phone and it’s also almost 3am so my brain is kinda done. 

I’m asking for advice because I really don’t know what to do because I’m not a professional or trained in any of this and I think I may have overstepped. I’m currently visiting a friend with two other friends (ofc following all covid regulations) and we‘re not in our home country which makes this a little bit more difficult. 

One of my friends has recently been diagnosed with severe depression and we helped her with going to a doctor and getting professional help. This is where the problem begins: even though we helped her see a doctor to show her that we support her and want to help her get better, she’s not really going through with anything. She stopped taking medication even though she’s only been on it for a couple of weeks and it usually takes some time to see if they work or not. The problem is that she didn’t take them for a long time as she forgot to take some and then decided to not take them anymore without consulting her doctor (because she said they don’t work). After consulting her doctor (who told her to slowly go down with the dosage) she didn’t go through with it and just continued to not take her medication at all. She has also been going to a therapist but hasn’t really „clicked“ with him which is obviously not a problem because not every therapist fits everyone  BUT she went there two times and then stopped because she didn’t like how he always told her the same things over and over again and didn’t really let her talk so she stopped going there without ever addressing this to him. She also hasn’t been looking into other therapists or getting new medication. 

We all know that it’s bad and that she currently experiences a „low“. 

So now that I’ve explained a little bit of the background information, I’ll come to the point that really concerns and frustrates me:

after dinner, she was talking to our friend (who has depression as well) and then told her that she wants to end her life sooner or later because therapy and medication won’t work for her and that she doesn’t see any sense in continuing her life like that.

The friend that she talked to was getting overwhelmed and called me in to talk to her and I basically told her that we will always be her support system but that some things are just too much even for us and that she has to talk to a professional because we can’t really change her thoughts or even talk to her the way a therapist would (and we also don’t want to say anything that could trigger her to do anything to herself). I then also told her that we can’t force her to go to therapy or take her medication but that we want her to try harder and find reasons that are worth living for because I know that she has reasons to stay alive (she also has told us that she doesn’t want to live or die). 

So this is the moment where I thought that I may have overstepped a bit because I told her that in the end we can’t force her to do anything and that we can only push her towards wanting to try harder but that we can’t decide for her if she wants to do it or not.

I also told her (because I didn’t know what else I could’ve said to explain it to her) that it’s just so much to think about if someone just tells you this out of the blue in such a casual tone. Because I obviously don’t want to say anything that could make her make her decision. Also I was a big harsh (which is obviously not right but I was overwhelmed) because I was getting angry with her for just casually telling us this. 

She had a panic attack after talking to me and now I’m scared that she’ll do anything to herself but we can’t really do anything because we’re not in our home country and obviously can’t force her to do anything she doesn’t want to do. I also don’t think that she wants to do it right now but it’s still important to make her try to go to therapy again and take her medication. 

I know this may sound selfish but I can’t really handle it? None of us really can because she just said it so casually and while we believe it’s urgent, we think she does not want to commit suicide right now (hence why the sooner or later). She just said without thinking about how this just immediately put us into „alarm mode“ and this also kind of explains me getting a bit harsh because it frustrated me that she didn’t even try to go through with therapy or medication (which was insensitive and I acknowledge that). And I know her not going to therapy or giving up on medication is caused by her depression, I just don’t know how to change it? I don’t know what to do.

If anyone could maybe give some advice, it would be appreciated..",depression

119458,"I don’t know what to say.For the past year and a half my partner and I have been fighting a false accusation of child abuse charges in Juvenile Court which has taken our child away from us. 

We found out through contacting experts and assessors that our child may possibly have an underlying medical condition (that we both have) that has caused fractures in our child’s body. The fractures found weren’t long bone, or what people generally think of when they hear the term “fracture.” They were small discrepancies between each of our child’s joints. The knees and the elbows. 

We’ve had doctors review our child’s medical records and x rays, to which they’ve found that they do not believe they were fractures at all, most certainly not abuse, but what appeared to be a collagen disorder. Through research this is something that we both found out, from the beginning, but then we had the reassurance of a doctor telling us this in a court room.

When it seemed like we’ve finally found the answer, we were wrong. The judge in the juv. court did not agree. The judge decided that one of us still abused our child, and that our child does not have a medical condition - despite the evidence that was found. 


We’ve been persecuted relentlessly, and have been told unless one of us admits to harming our child, then our child will not be returned to us. We’ve spent 10’s of thousands of dollars fighting this through doctor fees, legal fees, and are 10’s of thousands STILL in the hole. We barely get by month to month. The very bare essentials. 

Just recently we found out that along side our juvenile court case to which we’re still fighting in, we have after a year and half, finally had legal charges pressed against us. 

We now have a criminal case to fight for....

We’ve been talking to attorneys and friends and family, and in the process have been told that this is going to cost us exponentially more than we could have ever imagined. With the attorney fee(s), plus bail for jail for both of us alone - we’re looking at over 120k... the charges that were brought  against us according to the attorneys that’s at least 10k a piece for bond alone. 


This is something we only found out recently. And day by day, meeting by meeting, my self worth, my trust, my hope has diminished to nothing. The overwhelming amount of money everything costs... that we’re never going to be able to afford... the constant persecution of abuse that we didn’t do. I just don’t feel like it’s worth me being around anymore. I try to keep my focus on my partner... but it’s hard. Having to see them go through this, and see me struggle... and our child... our child is the only thing that has kept my eyes looking forward. But now saving them, and being a parent to them no longer looks like a possibility. 

Idk what to do, but I know that I don’t want to be here... I can’t afford to be here.... I don’t even know what the purpose of writing this out for strangers to read is even going to accomplish. I’ve prayed and prayed and I just don’t want to be here.

134889,"Mentally Ill people deserve to be treated like people and not pawns or agendasPeople love to pretend they at least respect depressed and anxious people (and I say pretend because even the more “socially acceptable” illnesses are looked down on and mischaracterized) but if you’re anything more, you’re a crazy person, you’re hard to understand, you need normal people to advocate for you and it’s so fucking transparent!!

We get groups made up of neurotypical people to represent us, we get media made about us by people who are running entirely on stereotypes, we get pushed therapy and meditation by people who don’t understand what helps, we get herded into groups and forced to talk about ourselves to people that are completely different than us, we get scrutinized and drugged up and labelled and mislabelled for the sake of it, and I’m so fucking tired!!

Most insultingly in my opinion, the idea that we can be “cured” is thrown around for the benefit of the people who have to DEAL with us, like somehow being completely normal is the goal for us instead of being able to cope and recover and thrive with what we’ve been given. And when we can’t live up to that we’re failing and hurting people and then wow look at how many people kill themselves huh isn’t it crazy 

We deserve our own damn agency, and things that will really help us, and the ability to represent ourselves and help people better understand us, and proper resources, and for people to care in a way that isn’t just them pitying the lesser folk. Which is all modern politics lends itself to. Surface level pity and fake understanding 

I am autistic and I am traumatized and anxious and depressed and I hallucinate and. Call me crazy all you want because maybe I am. But I want what’s best for me. And for people like me. And that means really listening and caring, and nobody’s ever going to do that for people like us. We deserve to make a big deal out of that",depression
208684,"I thought I had my way out but now I have nothingYesterday my mother took me to the doctor and I was prescribed Amitriptyline. I didn’t know what it was but as soon as I looked it up I felt like I finally had an opportunity. A couple of google searches showed it can be fatal. I’ve been looking for a way to die for a while and this is the first time I think I’ve finally found something that can let me leave in peace.

I thought about slitting my wrists, but I don’t want to do that. It’s pain and mess and it barely works. I’ve gone through enough shit as it is. I don’t feel like useless physical pain, an ICU visit, and ruining my life from endless judgement and being treated like shit the way suicidal people often are. So I ruled that one out.

I thought about hanging myself from my ceiling fan. I was going to do it with a sheet. Heard about how you can shit yourself doing it, or fall and break some bones so those were negatives. But again I need something. I just want to leave. Put a ladder up to the fan and realize it’s wobbly and weak. If I hang my fat ass from it, the whole ceiling will probably cave in. Great. Another one of the list.

All the research/googling/whateverthefuck I’ve done has shown that the best way to do it is to shoot yourself in the head. That’s great. Really fantastic. I’m not old enough to buy a gun, and if I was, I don’t have buy a gun money. I could steal from my mother but I’d rather not. Great option. Off the list.

The Amitriptyline was like a saving grace. I swear. I thought, finally. Finally. I have a way to fucking leave in peace. Take all of them and just go the fuck away. For ONCE. Of course, I had to do some research to be sure. I really need to stop researching, because the researching is what really fucks me over. Found out it can be lethal. Great! Now to know how much to take. Turns out, it’s an amount way above what I was prescribed. On TOP of that, endless stories of people taking a fuckton, yet still waking up in an ICU condemned to an earthly hell. Fantastic.

I really just want a way to leave. That’s all I’m asking for. I don’t want a lot. Just to fucking LEAVE. The universe has made it clear that it doesn’t want me here. People make it clear they could give a fuck about whether I’m here or not. That’s fine. But if that’s the case, it shouldn’t be so hard for me to just fucking kill myself. It shouldn’t.

I don’t do well with empty platitudes. If anyone really wants to help me, just let me know where the exit is. Greatly appreciated.",depression

Why did you leave me? I'm alone. You were my last hope of redemption. You were the last person I would smile at. I needed a friend.

Why did you leave me?

Why did you leave me?

Why am I so alone? Where are all the people who used to be in my life? Where are all the people I loved? Where are all the people without whom I could not live? Where are the too many guests at my birthday party? 

I have too many fingers to count those who remain. I don't think there are any left.

The student loneliness that we talk about so much only starts when the classes stop.

WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS!!! 

How did I get here?

I have no hope left. I have no future. I don't have any feelings anymore. I am no longer happy, sad, in love, angry, passionate, anxious, overexcited. Everything is gone.

I need to get better. I need to get better. I need to get better. I'm really going to die. My body can't take the pain in my head any longer. I'm really going to die. There's nothing else left. It's only a matter of days, my heart will stop beating on its own. I don't know when I last lived. I don't know when I last felt happiness. I don't know when I last felt an emotion. I would like to be drunk to forget everything. I would like to drown myself in alcohol so I don't remember that I don't feel anything.

No one can help me. It's too late, it was in December that I needed help. Now it's too late, I'm about to die. 

Why am I alone?

I remember when Ewen had his breakdown, and we were there for him. We talked about it in the class council, we made him go to the theatre with us, we invited him to parties, we checked on him at boarding school.

But today, everyone has had their fill of misfortune. We can't be there to support the others anymore, we don't have the shoulders. I just wish I still had one friend. To have just one hug. And cry. I would like to cry. Sometimes I read something or hear music, and I want to cry, but I can't. If there is a god somewhere, I beg him to stop my agony. Whatever the way. Please.

I have another Sam in my history class, and his last name comes before mine. The teacher (lets say Mr. T) coached the golf team I was on last year so he kinda knows me, but being a redditor and all I am a socially awkward fuck. Mr. T was going around asking each student for a fun fact about themself, so I assumed the other Sam would answer before me since it was alphabetical, just like attendance. The other Sam was on the same wavelength being kinda like me socially, though we aren’t good friends. 

Mr. T calls on Sam, so the other Sam unmutes and says he likes tennis, and names some random tennis player. Mr. T seems impressed with his knowledge and continues calling on students. The whole time I’m running through what I’m gonna say in my head, stressing and sweating about it. 

Then, he calls out the other Sam’s last name. I freeze, wondering if I should correct Mr. T and say my fun fact or keep my mouth shut. I decide the latter, not wanting to talk or deal with internet latency. The other Sam unmutes and says he already answered, but the call kinda breaks up and Mr. T repeats his question, asking for a fun fact. The other Sam gives up and says how he likes snowboarding. 

The calling continues. After he finishes calling on everyone, the bell rings and we hang up. Great. I have successfully avoided speaking in class resulting in my teacher thinking I am a tennis nerd.

83150,"I feel like times almost upHello Reddit. 

Created this account just to post this cause I've heard there's a helpful community here 

First of all- I'm a 17 year old male, overweight, junior in high school. I do pretty well academically- have around a 3.7 GPA this year and a 3.5 overall. Got a black belt in karate, am an eagle scout, and just that one person you see everyday that's always enthusiastic and smiling. Don't seem like the kind of person to be on the verge of committing suicide, right? 

Truth is though, I'm absolutely destroyed inside. And I've completely given up on myself- yet nobody knows. I've never been officially diagnosed with depression and no one's even raised eyebrow that I even am depressed. 

So, backstory- (just background on why I'm depressed, skip if not interested) both parents are immigrants and I live in this affluent upper-middle class pretty much all white suburb. Life was going great until I turned 8: sister was born with pre-existing life-threatening illness, parents left my life literally overnight and sent me to live with grandparents. Grandma's not fluent in English and grandpa (who is) is a complete egotistic asshole. Socially isolate myself and just play videogames, lose all friends, become fat, extended family spread throughout country helps parents, no one asks or gives a shit about me. So I'm left with no one to talk to at all. No one to share my feelings with. Become social outcast in school. Start thinking suicidal thoughts for the first time at age 9. Parents come back into my life after 3 years and I never (to this day) have trusted them again. 
6th and 7th grade in school goes terrible- turn into the school joke Everybody in school thinks I'm autistic (though Im not). 8th grade comes along and I isolate myself once more--- start working out and lose weight, bring BMI down from obese to overweight despite excercising daily, this was the first year I truly truly felt depressed. 9th grade I change my personality completely and start talking to people- become hit with the popular kids and well known throughout the school, initially as a joke but then people catch on to the fact I've changed and start talking to me. Year goes incredibly well become known as this all-around nice guy. 10th comes around and that's when the extreme suicidal and depressed thoughts came in. Self harm my self like crazy at home while keeping a smile on my face whenever I was in school or around my parents. That brings me to this year I've got all these people I can talk to, I've made plenty of acquaintances, and I still got that smile on my face, but I'm honestly just ready to end it all inside

There's honestly plenty more, but that's just a short overview of my life 




I honestly ain't worth most of you guys' time anyway so I'll just condense down to the reasons why I'm ready to just die: 
--------------------------------------------------
1) I feel like everybody hates me- a part of me tells me this isn't true, but I honestly got no one close to me anymore to tell me that

2) I hate myself- I hate the way I look, I think of myself as the ugliest person I've ever seen 

3) I don't understand life- I'm gonna have to go to college soon and I have no idea what I want to do. Nothing interests me. Also it seems like there's nothing but inevitable misery in the future. 

4) I feel like I've let everyone down and that I'm just a burden on people 

5) the biggest reason of them all is that I just feel completely lonely and rejected. Sure I've got lots people that I consider ""friends"" in school now but I've honestly never opened up to any of them. I don't have a personal connection with anyone in my life. No one knows what happened to me when I was a child, not even my parents 

6) I feel like I've fallen to far behind everyone else in high school to catch up- Everyone keeps telling me about how much they miss their high school years and how much fun they had- yet here I am, and I've never been invited to a party, yet alone someone's house

Don't get me wrong though Reddit, all I need is one person, literally one person in my life to come up to me and tell me how much I mean to them. I just don't know how to ask someone. I just don't know what to do except die 

So the question I have for you redditors is: 

Do you see any solution for the problem that is me? 

Cuz I honestly don't.

When I first joined I wasn’t sure how to feel about it. On one hand I understood but on the other I wanted to convince everyone who wrote those posts that things DO get better.

I attend a group counseling session and individual counseling. Earlier at group the two counselors that moderate asked me to stay back as they felt concerned about my behavior and all. It wasn’t a conversation I wanted to have because I’m just especially tired and hurt today. And I don’t like groups and was only there to appease someone. And it was frustrating feeling like they couldn’t hear me and I was getting so agitated so I asked them to let me just be alone. 

I was lying on the floor trying to put myself back together and was finally feeling like I could finish my day when someone knocked the door. They’d gone to find my individual counselor and them to come check in with me. I opened the door ready to go and the second I saw them everything in me just froze. I couldn’t do it. I got hysterical and started yelling and I couldn’t breath and in that moment I knew that I wanted nothing more than to die and stop the screaming in my head, just fucking silence it.

I understand all those posts now. Nothing is getting better. I feel like my time is almost here and it takes such a weight off my shoulders. I’m not good anymore. I will never be good again.

122029,"How do I offer support to someone who is suicidal while also suicidal myself?I've recently moved in with two of my closest friends and their 2 year old aon. I was in a situation where my mental health was being destroyed and these guys brought me into their family with the warmest embrace I have ever known.

I am suicidal. I have been more often than not in my life. They know this but its not something I like to talk about often nor am I a risk right now.

But I don't know how to handle this next bit appropriately.

See, one of them is also suicidal right now. Heavily abused growing up, he's never quite recovered - he's for the most part suppressed his feelings and worked his ass off like a boss. A total technology wizard. Blows my mind all the time with his creativity and the works.

He's been lashing out at his wife lately. Like, outbursts of emotion - accusing her of not giving him a honest answer because her tone was off, or that she is secretly laughing at him for being stupid.

It is recognizable as projecting and not being able to make certain connections in his mind right now. Both me and her know this.

But I lost my temper the other day as he was berating the most patient woman I have ever seen. I told him that it wasn't okay to speak to her like that. The night progressed and as we know dark spirals do - his words were of despair, self loathing, hopelessness and us being better off if he died. 

And nothing we said brought him peace.

And I probably said all the exact wrong things than suggested when talking to a suicidal person. I was and am at a lost.

I relate to his pain. With therapy I now recognize that those dark truths aren't the only truths for us yet I am also feeling those feelings of self hate and worthlessness. All my words of support feel hallow and untrue and we both know it.

I'm homeless living in my car and I cannot catch a break. My family is ripped to shreds and I'm the last one standing. I've pushed so hard to do real hard work and I only get abuse and made fun of. I can't seem to find anyone who can deal with how unstable I am, I've been through shit like anyone else but I'm trying. I just got kicked out for being too much of a victim. Hah.

Then last night, I don't know what is was, it all came back to me in a flood. 

I usually just try to take things one day at a time. The demons of my past I can often just press down, just to handle the normal stresses of the day.

But last night there it all was, and it was a panic attack it hurt so bad. How much I regret destroying my friendship of my best friend of fifteen years. How much I regret getting fired by a therapist who I trusted completely and went to every week for four years. Despair onlver this crippling agoraphobia and o.c.d. that won't abate, despite medication and therapy. And a lot of honest effort on my part.

And just being so sorry I yelled at my therapist and got fired, when she was everything to me. She was the only person who was there for me these past 5 years, and then a year ago that was it. She had had enough and said I needed someone else. I want to throw up when I think how furious I got, the angry emails I sent her. I just can't believe she's gone.

It was just a sudden resurgence of all the pain and grief and regret, all evening. I still feel totally knocked off balance, like I thought I had put this shit behind me and then it's all back. And the anxiety was so sickening and consuming. It reminded me of all the pain I was in constantly before getting on tranquilizers.

46290,"I struggle so much with having done this...Ok trying to make this as brief as possible:

Mental breakdown around January last year. Went from an extremely heavy and skinny smoker who only ate garbage to a gym rat. Eating, eating, eating, 4000 calories of the healthiest food per day, becoming strong and healthy. Always hitting the gym. 

However: I get filled with regrets because the contrast is so huge. I feel like I'm about to die. Also get so fucking angry at myself and feel like the biggest failure ever. I mean... Who smokes!? Who neglects his health!? Only losers do that. Self-esteem below zero. Suicidal thoughts. Extremely depressed. 

I contact my ex to talk about it. Look up to her because she's 8 years older. I'm 28, she's 36. Tell her I miss her and she blocks me. In an impulse I make a new account and I start it off on the wrong foot with extremely negative texts like calling life pointless bullshit (fucking toxic behavior of me) she gets angry and I feel like I have to explain myself. She constantly says something I want to reply to and then blocks me so I keep making new accounts. One time she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so I make a new account one last time to reply with 'but I did change'... Then she explodes. Writes a message to hurt me as much as possible and says she will never reply again. Says shit like 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... Saying that to me in my situation is pure poison for my brain. It's black on white and becomes engrained in my brain. Everything went wrong here. How I started it off with those negative texts and then tried to save it by continuing to make new accounts while my ex just wanted me to leave her alone. My ex also being unempethatic as fuck which makes me want to explain myself even more. Her ending it in that horribly cruel last message...

After that it keeps repeating in my head every single minute of the day. I'm so frustrated, angry and sad that she said that to me because it completely ruins my mental health and makes me feel hopeless while she doesn't know the full story. The only thing that made me feel proud of myself is how I've turned my life around, but that feels completely in vain after her last message. I can't cope with it and constantly write messages and delete them again only to write them again everyday explaining myself and apologizing. I also insult her back and say horrible things at some point. Most of it was friendly though. Telling her I know it was bad what I did. She never replies. After like 4 months of doing that shit she gets rid of her instagram 😓 I wrote a last extremely personal e-mail to her work, but she left that company so it got forwarded to her co-workers. Holy shit. 

Conclusion: I've turned into a stalker. Should I kill myself? I can't live with the embarrassment and shame... It's also not something I did in the heat of the moment. I kept contacting her day after day. It's a pattern. I'm just a fucked up person.",depression

I have been suicidal since I was 15, hospitalized once, am now 21 but have still struggled all my life. Been in therapy all my life, it never helped. One suicide attempt. Recently (in the past 3 months or so) my mom has intervened and made me see a psychiatrist. It took me a while to go, but I eventually did. My doctor (pediatrician/adult family practice dr) had been managing my mental health up until this point, but I wasn’t sure if any of the meds were helping. I had tried many different ones from several different classes of drugs. I think I felt uncomfortable talking to my doctor about how I really felt and always wanted to say things were fine. However, at the new psychiatrist I decided to be completely honest. I have suffered mental/physical/sexual abuse and I just told him everything and how I was feeling. Prior to this I was just laying in bed, not working or going to school (I withdrew from college) and was just drinking myself away all day until it was time to sleep. My psychiatrist prescribed a different medication he said my doctors should’ve tried and took me off my old medication. It was a really tough transition and I had a nervous breakdown twice, but now I am completely off the other med and on the new med. Things are different now. Before I couldn’t even see color that well, it all seemed grey, and it seemed suicide was inevitable. Now I can see everything vibrantly and experience life differently. I am a totally changed person. I am happy and optimistic, I think about a happy future, I make better choices, I care about myself and life. This also gave me the courage to see a therapist and tell them everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, I didn’t hide a single thing. And I felt better after letting it all out. Now I am working on my substance abuse issues, which are definitely still there, and I still have some skeletons in the closet, but I feel like the rough patch has finally ended. I feel like I can finally be me again and figure myself out and live a normal life. And I want you all to know, I really didn’t make that many healthy changes before this medication started to work. And I just wanted to give some home to you guys that sometimes it really is medication that makes all the difference in the world. And it really is worth it to talk to a psychiatrist and tell them everything.

I hear “kill yourself” literally spoken in my head so many times every day. I have a family that loves me but I have no emotional connection with any of them, though I do feel some sort of love or responsibility for them. I’ve distanced myself from them unintentionally over the last 10 years from extreme anxiety and how I seem to explode on them when I become stressed.

I started to get to know this girl, long distance, I know, but there was a real connection. I ruined it with my commitment issues and anxiety to meet her. There’s a little more to it than this but I’m not good at expressing my feelings and especially writing them. 

I don’t know what more there is to say. I started taking Zoloft, I feel different but not better. The thoughts and feelings are still there but I feel completely frozen and suppressed when they come on hard.

319596,"""Your life matters"" but it feels like nobody wants to deal with you.I live in the UK. I've had 6 weeks of paid, useless therapy,  I've been on antidepressants for over a month. Today I asked to be referred to a psychiatrist and it seems like the doctor over the phone just dismissed it and told me to refer to the crisis team when I'm feeling suicidal urges. Every waking moment that I'm not distracted, I think about killing myself, and apparently that's not enough to get a goddamn mental health evaluation, at the very least.

When I've referred to the crisis team in the past, they're quick to blame everything on my drug use, which is one of the few things keeping me going and I'm making the effort to cut down on. They won't even consider counselling for you if you drink often. Regardless of that, they still love passing you around, Even if I managed to get counselling, I'd have to wait until I'm back at university, since I'm only temporarily registered at my home residence. Pretty much boils down to ""not our problem.""

Everyone talks to you in the most nonchalant tone of voice, I'm aware it's for a reason, but it just adds to sense that you're nothing but a nuisance. All my gran has to say in response to this is ""too many people in the world, there aren't enough psychiatrists."" I've got a noose tied in my bedroom, I can make one less person, if that's the problem.

319779,"Scared, lost, disoriented, aloneLiving a horrifically unstable, unsustainable lifestyle and don't know what to deal. Have been struggling with Bipolar 1/Bipolar depression, severe alcoholism, and gender dysphoria for years. Mid-20s, utterly alone in a major American city. No friends. Unemployed, officially. Been doing sex work (I'm AFAB trans and pre-testosterone, so the sex work is worse because it's crucial that I act like a woman) in order to pay for cheap rooms to stay in, one week at a time. Had almost six months clean and sober, but relapsed earlier this month and my tolerance has gotten higher and higher - my habits and not having a permanent residence make it impossible for me to save money for an apartment. I've been cut off from my family for years, and isolated myself from my social circle months ago. I have no support, and no hope.

I don't know where to turn. I don't know what to do. Ever since I was a 13-14, I pictured an early death for myself: didn't think I'd live to graduate high school, or turn 21, or ever get out of my small hometown. Have never had long-term plans because my life has always been a cycle of chaos, mental illness, substance problems, and poverty. Don't know how I'm even still alive, but I don't want to be anymore. There's a draw, almost like a physical pull towards death for me; it's like it's lurking just around the corner waiting for me to finally accept it.

Sorry to be so self-centered, and probably melodramatic. I just feel like my time is coming to an end very, very soon. I had a very real plan, but confessed to my therapist and ended up being put in the psych ward against my will - and not for the first time.

Don't think I can take this life much longer. Maybe there will be more peace in the next life - but can I count on coming back if I kill myself? I've been told suicide is the route straight to Hell or bad reincarnation, point blank. I guess spirituality is literally the only thing keeping me here (and I apologize -- I know this may be tough to relate to bc Reddit is heavily atheist/agnostic). I fear the consequences of offing myself, but am desperate for the release of it, and the freedom from my own insanity.

Sorry for the wall of text. Thank you to anyone who has read this far (which was probably not anyone - I know I wouldn't bother with myself). It just feels good to get this off my chest, even on just some random anonymous internet account &amp; screaming into the abyss.

Hopefully soon, I'll OD and not wake up. Thank you.",depression

Ever since I was young I always thought that suicide was a selfish thing to do. It's something a lot of people think, at least to my knowledge. I'm in college now, and my mother has been guilt-tripping me about how much it costs her me being here. Little does she know she's only contributing arguments to the side of me that wants the jump off a fucking building. The more my life goes down the toilet the more I see suicide as a relief, not only to me, but to every other life I manage to ruin by proxy.

After all, all I've done so far of any significance is weigh people that I love down. Wouldn't it be a kindness to get this obstacle out of their way? Is it really *that* selfish? And if it is, so what? I'm supposed to keep suffering so people don't have to cry about it for some time?

158774,"Having my daily late night anxiety attack and venting/cryingI have such a good life. I have everything I could ever want. Good parents (divorced tho), money, airsoft equipment, and other stuff I don’t deserve. But I just can’t stop having these late night anxiety attacks and suicidal episodes. I suck at everything I do and I feel like I’m always the  one being frowned upon. I’m only 14 and my future is already basically crashing and burning. I can barely pass each grade without failing at least 2 of my classes during the semester. I’m decently overweight already and I can’t seem to do shit about it. I have about 3 friends and only talk to 2 of them. None of them even have much of the same interests as me. Half of which would probably get me unfriended. (I’m into the furry fandom stuff) I feel like everything I do is annoying or bothering to people. I can’t even talk to my step siblings without wanting to go to my room. Nobody like me and I can understand why. I’m fat, I can’t get anything done, Im lazy , and all I think about is how much of a fucking waste of space and money I am. I’m basically just another npc everyone sees but never interacts with. My disgustingly unkept room is really my only safe space to me. It’s where I want to be constantly. 

So what’s the point. Why should I keep going if I know damn well my future is gonna be fucked. I’m already 180 dollars in debt, so imagine what having to deal with larger amounts of money will be like. I would kinda like to tell my parents about my thoughts but either way they both will flip out and do a complete clean of my room of anything that can be used as a way to do the deed. Meaning I’d lose my airsoft guns, a complete denial of any knife over a butter, my golf cart driving permissions, and probably any type of medication. Which I may need if I get diagnosed with ADHD in my upcoming dialysis I requested with my mom.

120485,"I killed someone because I took too long to kill myselfI've never posted on Reddit before so here goes nothing.

About 4 or 5 years ago this girl I knew killed herself, the thing is I know for a fact that I could've kept her alive. Around that time and even way before then I was suicidal, I almost attempted suicide several times but always backed out at the last second, if I died before she did the world wouldn't have lost anyone important. The girl would've thought about what she was doing and realised she wasn't an actual waste of space, at least my death would've saved a goddamn life.

I read and reread the articles posted about her death several times a week, thinking over and over again how I could have single-handedly saved her before she even became that desperate. I think about it when people tell me I'm a good person, or smart, or celebrate anything to do with me. I think about it when I go to sleep, when I'm proud of myself, when I'm happy, sad, angry. I think about it every new years, every birthday, every Christmas. It haunts me in life too, I now share a class with someone who knew her better than I did (I'm in college now so it's not even the same school) and every time I look at them I remember. I really feel like I've gotten away with murder and its horrible, I can't live with this guilt.

I feel like I'm responsible for so many of my friends' pain and their suicidal thoughts because I simply can't be a better friend to them - I want to blame my autism but I think I'm just a defective human being in general. Since the girl died, several of my friends have come close to suicide, heck, I even watched my own mother try to kill herself. Now that she's divorced I'm scared she'll try again because she's so depressed. My younger sister is in a really bad place too and I'm so scared that she'll fuck up her life because everyone around her is falling apart.

I can't live with the guilt of killing that girl so I've planned a day to die in a couple of years. That leaves me with enough time to try and fix everything that appears to be broken so I keep trying to lift people's spirits and be friendly (I'm pretty bad at it, it's not working) while at the same time not letting anyone know how I feel because I don't want to waste anyone's time when I'm going to die anyways (although I guess this post technically counts so sorry for wasting your time). Just to make sure that I do die in the next few years, I've already begun to sabotage my own life. I didn't apply to university and I plan to just fail my college course and screw up my attendance so that I just end up getting a dead end job that makes me wanna kill myself even more.

I've been wanting to kill myself since I can remember, trying to suffocate myself with my own pillow is one of my earliest memories. I think hanging would've been the way to go, I now know how to tie a noose from memory so I make mini nooses for my finger out of string whenever I'm bored. That's definitely how I'm going to kill myself, especially since that was how the girl died, it just seems fitting. I've also stocked up on medicine in case I want to overdose instead, and I guess I could just drink bleach or rat poison or something but I'm too much of a coward to do that.

These days this whole thing plays on my mind a lot more so I might just kill myself this year, I dunno, the only reason I'm still alive is cause I like playing video games to be honest. I have to time it right though cause I don't want anyone else to feel like it's their fault. 

Honestly the biggest fear I have is that I won't go through with it again and that someone else will die again. I just hope I'm brave enough this time.

I guess the other thing I want to say is if you're reading this and you feel like you want to die, you probably don't deserve to and I'm really really sorry for whatever's going on, I hope things get better for you.",depression

I see so much hate and ignorance everywhere. It makes me depressed. Nobody bothers to think rationally or educate themselves it seems. Do people just wish the worst for anyone that disagrees with them now?!

Then there's the people and animals around the world that are suffering. And the people around the world that are just evil. I saw an article recently about KIDS who did some truly horrific things to some animals.

I have my reasons, emotional as well as logical, to know it is a correct decision and it's going to help me, and, in a long run, my enviroment. If not for one small problem i can guarantee i would be 100% dead already.

This 'problem' is basically my mother. She went through a lot. She has her own problems, including deppression and paranoia. She is totally overprotective about me and really focused on me. She always says that i'm everything that she has left etc. And the problem is that as soon as she learns i killed myself she is going to go totally crazy and kill herself as well. I know her enough and even small criticism can totally make her go crazy. 

Because of this i know that killing myself i basically kill her as well and this is not allowing me to do this. What would you advise me to do? Call the police and tell them about what my mother is going to do just before commiting suicide? Or should i invite whole family to the house so they can calm her down after?

I remember seeing you for the first time and I was so curious to find out who you are and your interests. Something about the way you moved, smiled, and spoke just made me happy. I talked to you, and I didn't know I liked you until I spoke to someone about you. I remember that date with you and how happy I felt afterwards and how happy I was when I heard you'd go on that date with me. I felt like I finally got something I wanted for a long time. I grew attached to you, so much that it made it so very difficult to speak to you as I thought about every word I would speak in every conversation...When I would see you in the hallways I'd be so happy and I'd laugh. Everytime I hugged you I felt amazing and loved. Then you distanced yourself from me. You slowly pushed me away and said that you're not interested anymore. Not interested? But I am still....It's been 8 months and I still am interested and I haven't looked at a girl since you...I couldn't lose you after all that time I spoke to you, I can't lose you the same way I've lost people. Not you. Oh God not you. I like you. I love you. You liked me. You hate me. My happiness declined and everything I enjoyed lost its sensation. Drumming became dull for me, my grades didn't matter anymore, my friends don't matter anymore, my life doesn't matter anymore. Not without you.

You were perfect, what did I do wrong?

I'm not mentally stable or happy since last 8 years. I'm in depression since then. I can't afford to sit idle now. The only thing which is making me live is my mother. I'm living, struggling only because I want to take care of her.


She always suggested me not to escape from any situations. But, now I'm sensing it is the only way out for me. I have almost no friends. I can't share my thoughts, regrets or anything with anyone, which I believe is killing me too. I had given 5-6 interviews in last 6 days but no affirmation. Only thing which is killing me is my pathetic sadistic and capricious nature. While I can think that I worth something, most of the times, I believe everyone is living their life perfectly, laughing, enjoying. I don't know what should I do now. It seems ending a life is the final option for me now. ",depression

The only thing stopping me at this point is fear of screwing it up, and just maiming myself. I'm just looking for a surefire way.  I don't know why I'm posting this... for attention?

I've been in a deep depressive state for months and I honestly don't care anymore. The only reason I'm alive is because of my children.

I don't tell my friends about these intrusive thoughts. I had to move to a pretty remote part of town because my husbands court order says he has to stay within the same school zone as his ex. 

I hate having my life run by a piece of literal trailer trash (actual trailer trash. My stepsons room was a closet in a trailer for a while.) 

I hate that my mother let her brother molest me as a child and she blames it on me. I hate that she treats me and my kids like crap and only comes around when it makes her look good. 

My stepson intentionally gave me a concussion in May and my husband didn't take any time off work to help me because he had just taken a week off for himself a few weeks before that. I was in the hospital 2 weeks ago for kidney disease that I have. I have a kidney stone that's stuck and won't pass, and its causing me absolute agony every second of the day. No one cares or is willing to help. My husband had to go to the ER last week for something minor and now he's off work for a week, but doing nothing to help.

310509,"Petition to stop ""attacking"" teachers and start appreciating them  Ok so many people have been kind of like ""attacking"" teachers. Attacking isn't the right word but that's all I can think of at the moment.

Anyways people you need to calm down,  they are underpaid, have to grade 8 classes worth of work each week,  and on top of that get called out by most people just for doing they're jobs.

Like most teachers only give one page of homework a day wich let's be honest it isn't alot most of us  could probably blow through most of it in an hour or two unless you have to write some essays wich at the end of the day they also have to read and grade too just that they have to grade 8 classes worth of it.

Also it isn't like they have much control over what they give they are most likely just following a textbook so they dont have a choice they are most likely just doing what they are told to do. 

Another thing is that they are struggling just as much as we are with the whole home learning thing, I mean most of us just turn off our mic and camera and just stay silent the whole class if we stay during the entire class. 
I had my Spanish teacher start crying during class because of the stress it causes like having only one or two people participating most having several missing assignments and some not even there.

We might have alot of work but they probably have tripple that that we don't see, so we should give them some slack. And start appreciating they're work instead of calling them out for things that they most likely have no control over.

161060,"How far-fetched is it to send a plushie to space? Hi, this might sound dumb, but I saw the story of SpaceX’s launch with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, where a stuffed dinosaur served as a zero-g indicator. There’s more information on this here - https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/5/30/21272222/spacex-launch-toy-stuffed-animal-dinosaur-zero-g-indicator

I have a very strong love for a manga series, Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun. Coming from somebody who is neurodivergent, Hanako-kun is a huge comfort character for me. Hanako is a ghost who, when he was alive, had a strong interest in space. He wanted to go to the moon, and was supposed to be a science teacher when he grew up, but he died at the age of 13, losing any hope of ever leaving earth. While this may be fictional, I still have a lot of sympathy for this character, and I own a plushie version of him in which I carry with me all over the place. 

The use of plushies as zero-gravity indicators is tradition among astronauts. I probably sound crazy for considering this, but do you guys think the Hanako plushie could be sent to someone that could get him up in space? Doesn’t matter how high up/how long he would be up there, just the thought of getting him up in space like he dreamed is a concept that makes me so happy and emotional.

I know that sounds like a joke but I'm dead serious. I have a ruger. 


These things have ruined not only my life but society in general. And we're all so brainwashed into thinking we NEED them and if we don't give one to our underage children then we're bad parents...


Seriously I've had people tell me I'm making my son an outcast and he's going to hate me. Because I won't give him a powerfully addictive life waster. Because having a phone in his face constantly won't ruin him socially.


 There's no such thing as privacy anymore.
People share the most dreadfully mundane aspects of their lives with literally the entire world. 


They do God-awful stupid things for internet points. Lick an ice cream at the store and put it back. Throw a chair out the window and several stories down into traffic. Why not if strangers give you temporary validation. 


No one leaves their social media echo chambers. You can't disagree or have rational debate anymore and it's put my country on the verge of civil war. 


The individual revolution and it's consequences have been a disaster for mankind.

71274,"My university feels like it’s pushing me to kill myselfI have GAD, finally on medication for it since last fall. I also have depression and my medication treats it as well. My university has been an absolute pain this summer, I just want to relax but it feels like my summer is going to be wasted focusing on school which makes me even more anxious. My dad retired since this spring so we have less money, I live at home atm but next year will be dorming so I’m a dependent for now. The uni emailed me saying I’ll lose my grant because they see something changed with my income so I sent an appeal to show I just have less money now which wouldn’t disqualify me according to my grant’s rules, I would actually qualify for more maybe. The next thing I know I check my email and I’m on academic probation for not passing 67% of my units, I passed literally 66.67% of them. And they still put me on probation. I think if I missed only .001% of my units they’d still put me on probation. This is all my fault because I failed one class this term, and since I took only a few classes the averaging they calculated really hurt me. I’m so stupid, I’m so stupid I tried to take less because I couldn’t handle more but now I fucked myself over. If I weren’t so stupid and anxious I could’ve done more for that class. So now I have to fly back there for a day (I’m in another state nearby atm) go to meet with my academic advisor and get a signature on a document, then 15 minute class on financial aid, take a quiz after, and then mail an appeal and hope they give me back my aid. All of this over 0.33% failed units. I hate my life, I’m an idiot. I have to do all this in 2 weeks, then wait another week or two for their decision. I’m so panicked, I‘m going to be overwhelmed for weeks on end. I just wanted my summer to be good. I don‘t start school until the end of August but it feels like I lost all my time and ruined my life and I’m hurting my parents. The beginning of this year my grandma died, after living with her for all my life it’s like my mom died. Then my parent’s decided to move which I was against and hurt my heart to be away from home. Then I try to do classes with all this on top of my mental illnesses and I fail. I wish I didn’t exist to begin with, and then I could spare my dad the stress of this. I wish I were better at all subjects, and if I didn’t have anxiety I would probably have not failed because I would’ve had the capability to do better and not be fearful. If I die now then I cause more despair to people close to me but my existence is causing myself and others pain too so. The best solution is that I never existed to begin with. I wish, I wish that was the case.",depression

56548,"My failureLast night I decided to kill myself.  Obviously I didn't succeed.
It's not a new thought to me; the first time I tried, I was 11 or 12 years old.  My parents were going through what was essentially a divorce in every way except legally, meaning that they were emotionally and physically apart but still lived under the same roof ""for my sake.""  They still do, and they hate each other.
That was 5ish years ago, and after getting my heart broken by my best friend, I decided to do it.  Every hope and dream I had was shattered and out of reach.  I had distanced myself from the rest of my friends and my family was in shambles.  My beloved dog passed away just 2 months ago, and one of my friends I had made in the mental hospital jumped in front of a train just one month prior to that.  Why stick around?
I was so ready to do it.  I knew it would hurt like a bitch, but at that point it was 2 am and I was distraught and exhausted.
But standing there with the rope around my neck, I was suddenly accosted by what I suppose is my survival instinct.  It was as though I was every age I've ever been and every age I have yet to be all at once.  The little kid in me still wanted to grow up, go to prom in the spring, graduate, see college, buy a horse, fall in love...  And my future self seemed to be telling me that I'm being immature, and that as I grew older my problems now wouldn't seem so vast.  And then there was my current self, begging me to die.
I stood there for a long time before I eventually went back to my room.  I was crying, and my best friend was frantically texting me and begging me not to go even after he broke my heart just 2 hours earlier. 
Now I don't know what to do.  Standing there in the cold gave me some perspective (but I know that I'll most certainly get hospitalized when I tell my therapist all this).  I suppose that the hopeful little kid in me still wants to try, even though each and every wish seems wildly out of reach.

Sorry, I can't believe I am posting this but honestly it's come to the point that I'm scared of what I might do to myself. I've been unemployed since the beginning of August and have had zero luck looking for jobs since then. I actually quit my job to pursue a successful business I had started  with but my luck turned to the worst when I lost my business right as I quit my job. I was hoping I wouldn't have to enter the workforce again, but here I am and because I currently don't have a job it makes finding another job exponentially more difficult. I had hope that I'd get a role at a start-up I interviewed for but I just got my rejection letter today which I can add onto the pile of other rejection letters I've gotten. I had always hoped I'd live a successful life but god gave us Covid and killed my dreams. Not just my job, but everything I had was ruined with Covid and I am financially in the hole. 

I have had suicidal idealization for \~7 years now that has been on/off based off my external circumstances. The past 2 months have brought me to the lowest I've been mentally in the past 7 years, thinking of suicide daily and more recently planning on ways of doing it. It almost feels like I can't control the thought and in times of clarity I think to myself that I shouldn't and can't do it. The biggest thing stopping me is my mom &amp; dad who would be destroyed if I did it (I'm an only child). Also I have a best friend who attempted years ago and when I got a call from him in the hospital I broke down crying and I don't want him or my girlfriend to feel that way about me. I can't keep the thought out of my head that ending it all will be my way of getting back at society for the way my life turned out.

So basically I feel like I’ve wasted my life so far, particularly my teenage years. I’m 18 now and have just realised what I’ve missed, being me. 

I haven’t been able to express myself, I was always too afraid to come out as gay and be me. I’m living an alternative version of me, one that pretends I’m strong, one that pretends I’m not interested in relationships, one that pretends I’m ok. But I’m not ok, I want to be me but I feel like I can’t, I feel like I’ve missed the time I was supposed to develop and find myself, instead I still live in a lie. 

I’m sad, pathetic and weak. I’ve lost all my friends and my relationship with my family has deteriorated. I think sometimes I just want to fold myself up as tight as possible and cry, but then I remember my mum tell me that boys don’t cry, boys are strong, but I’m not. 

I’ve failed at everything, I have no skills to speak of and no way to continue my life as it is. I can’t even write properly. I just don’t think there’s much point to my life anymore, I’m just a burden on people. When ever I text people I feel guilty that they have to take time to talk to ME the useless, shy and sad kid. I have nothing to give to the world but I am taking everything. People include me in things not because they want to but they feel they have too.

I’ve resorted to posting pictures of myself on online in an attempt to give me validation, a reason to keep going. But then I look at myself as think ‘what is that why would anyone like that’. People tell me I’m cute but I’m not, at least I don’t think I am. Im just another annoying person filling up space that could be occupied by someone useful. 

I can’t bring myself to keep going, I don’t feel like there’s anything for me here. I don’t want to die, I’m scarred of death but I sometimes think that’s really the only option left. I don’t like to think that I’m depressed, just sad and lonely. 

I’m an imposter in my own body. I want to be able to paint my nails with the girls and go drinking with my buddies but I don’t have any buddies to talk of. I’m just lonely, sad, and useless. 

I don’t really know why I’m writing this here, cause I know not many people will see it, I know people will just say empty words to make me feel better, I know I’m just waisting mine and everybody else’s time just like I’ve wasted my life. I have no confidence and no friends and no skills.

I am thinking about suicide 24/7. Basketball is the only thing that stops me to think about suicide. So a lot off my time I spend on r/nba.

One time I was so close to do it. I was sitting on top of the building ( I am not scared of hight, so my ideal suicide would be to jump from the building). At that moment my best friend got some feeling and he called me. He told me that he is feeling weird and asked me if I am ok. I told him everything and he came in few minutes. He saved my life there.. From that day he is the only person who knows about this and he is trying to help me out.

I know I can't do it because it would hurt to many people, I have feeling that my best friend would do suicide after that to. My parents would do suicide to. I just don't want to someone die because of me. 

Because I can't die, I need to find another way. So is there any way to feel emotion. I would more like to be sad and depressed then to feel nothing.",depression

181277,"Being aware that I'm being used... So this girl who was cheating behind my back with multiple guys (4-5 months ago) texted me outta nowhere apologizing and shit and wanting to be friends again (2 weeks from now). She started calling me often and we'd talk for hours as if nothing ever happened in the past. But today when she called, I came to know EXACTLY why she started doing all this. She mentioned that one guy that I KNOW FOR SURE slept with her but she doesn't admit (have gone through quite heartbreaking screenshots and videos from her google photos as proof) well that guy has stopped talking to her since 2 weeks (yup, lines up quite accurately)

The way she talked to me so far made me believe she doesn't have any of those fuccbois around her to talk with her, hence she started talking to me again. After finding out about her sleeping with other dudes, I never thought I'd have her in my life again, nor I wanted her back in my life to begin with. But talking to her does make me feel nice. These past few months I've been feeling quite lonely and having her back in my life doesn't feel bad although it absolutely should. She's the only girl I ever dated and we dated for like 3 years. Never doubted her, never checked her phone when I should've.

So like, the only reason I'm still in touch with her is that I'm using her to compensate my loneliness, but the outcome is going to be quite obvious as eventually that dude will start talking to her again and she'll stop talking to me. I wonder for how long I'll keep doing this...

When I was 11 years old, I tried to kill myself. 

I took 13 sleeping pills from my grandmother and went to go lay in bed. A couple minutes later my mom came in my room to ask me if I was hungry. I was anorexic at the time, and I barely ate anything because I hated the way I looked. 

My mom tried waking me up but she couldn’t do it, she found the bottle of pills under my pillow and apparently called an ambulance.. My doctor was screaming at me but I only remember little pieces of what happened, my heart stopped before they could pump my stomach and they got it going again. I remember looking up in the hospital bed and looking around, everything was bright but dark as-well. 

I hallucinated, felt sick, and was so tired for the next couple of weeks. I don’t know what happened within the first three days. I was blacked out for a half of a week and had these terrible headaches for weeks after it happened.

And the thing I do most is invalidate my own feelings. Whenever I feel like I genuinely might be depressed, I tell myself “Stop doing that. There’s people who have it way worse then you and you’re crying over that?! Shut up. You’re fine, just dramatic.” I feel really stressed about small things too.

I know whats gonna happen. Its going to stain my life and ruin a part of me, just like everything else does. 

I find myself almost perpetually in envy of others. Nothing ever seems to come to me in moderation. Im a cripple, depressed, personality disorder, covered in scars from accidents and surgeries....I just cant take it anymore. It makes it worse having to go be a part of the world, watching everyone go along with ease. Listening to people talk about their struggles makes me jealous. Im not trying to invalidate peoples struggles, I know there are people who are having a much more difficult time than I am. What I also know however, is that the great majority of people my age dont have these struggles. Bad things come, and then they just....go. Just like that for them. They tackle it and its gone...I would give anything for that. Problems arise in my life and they seem to ALWAYS take a part of me I will never get back.

282428,"My friend is obsessed with his exOK I (20F) have a friend (20M) that has so much issues and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm just going to explain his story because I'm just out of options and maybe someone can help me with this.

So this friend, lets call him Rick, has had a really rough year with his mom dying and a boyfriend (yeah he gay) that cheated while they we're 'on a break'. Rachel and Ross kind of shit. Rick also stopt school because he was so devastated about his mom, which led to him having to leave a studenthome, so he also does not have a home right now. He's staying with me because his whole family sucks and his dad's also a selfish dickhead. The dad, Rick and the ex had a conversation about what happend between them and how it's going to be after. (I don't really know how to explain properly sorry I'm Dutch) While the conversation starting to get heated because my friend felt really misunderstood and depressed about the whole situation, led him to slam the table and break his own f\*cking hand.

So the situation is my friend, that now has a broken hand, no job, no boyfriend, no mom, no school, and no home.

I still think this ex is a dick for cheating on him, when his mom just f\*cking past away for like a month and all of the other circumstances. I have to say that they we're on a break, but he also found out that the ex talked to him (the other guy) for over a month while they (Rick and his ex) were still dating.

Rick still cries over him everyday and really misses him because he was the only good thing he had when his mom died. Every time I come home from work and ask how he's doing, and it's always: 'No I hate my life"". He's really depressed to a point that I don't even know what to say anymore. My friend texted the ex everyday which led on the ex blocking my friend on everything (every social media account). I already told Rick a million times that the ex is a dick and that he does not deserve all the attention he's getting right now. But my friend doesn't care and is REALLY obsessed with his ex. He sent flowers, candles and yet he doesn't get any response. The ex only says that he want's to be left alone.

I already tried talking to Rick about that he really has to calm down on this and have to respect the decision of the ex about that he (clearly) want's to be left alone. He has to focus on himself and fix the situation. I have to be really careful talking to my friend because he's really depressed and I seriously don't know if he might kill himself if I'm being too harsh. I'm one of the only friends he has left because Rick is a bit of a difficult person to deal with and I don't want him to think that I'm not on his side anymore and no one understands him.

I told him to talk to a psychiatrist and he went to one meeting. He said that it was OK but not really convinced.

The only thing he's talking about is his ex, he doesn't care about his own life but does care about his vanity, HE BUYS A LOT OF STUFF, everyday I come home he bought something else, which his grandma provides, because he himself does not have a job.

I'm really starting to feel a bit irritated because he won't listed to me, he won't look for a job and he's living with me since the end of November, takes all the money from his grandma he can get and the only thing he does all day is talking about his ex, buying unnecessary shit and smoking weed. (I live in Amsterdam.) I have a small apartment with one bedroom and he's staying on the couch. I don't feel like I have privacy anymore and I already tried talking to him about him leaving but he seriously does not have another place to go (I tried calling friends and family of him, but everyone has an excuse). I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm the only person left to help him but he sucks all the energy out of me. I tried making a plan with him, but he doesn't care and doesn't do the things I tell him to do (find a job, that kind of stuff). But I feel like if I just leave him alone that he might feel no ones with him or worst, that he might kill himself.

Does anyone have any tips maybe... I feel like this is a bit of a stretch because I already asked friends and everyone says things like: If he doesn't want te be helped, there is nothing you can do. But maybe someone knows something I can do.. Idk.. I'm just a bit desperate I guess and I really do care about Rick.

117920,"It legitimately feels ""right"" for me to die. I didn't think about suicide literally until I was 11 years old, but before that I was very obsessed with the concept of death in the sense that I would disappear from the world around me, like being taken away to a magical land (Neverland, in my mind). Childhood was pretty shitty so I had an unhealthy habit of escapism that has had some serious tolls on my mental health today.    
 So after 11 years of age, I thought about it a lot, threatened to do it, but never got around to it until 3 months ago when I decided to just off myself with a bottle of pills. Didn't work, but I knew I didn't want it to, I just wanted to manipulate the people close to me by convincing them that I was actually serious about it. A warning, in other words. I want to kill myself to spite others, but in another mindset, I want to do it because it just ""feels right."" I feel like my time has long been past.    
 I really don't know what to do. I have many talents, I'm attractive, I got into the university of my choice, yadda yadda...but it just doesn't feel right to be alive. I'm already seeing a psychiatrist as a result of the suicide attempt but it doesn't really help. It's just something to do.    
 I feel like Frodo, to be honest. I've been through crap and yet even if I saved the world in the end, it just doesn't make sense to go on. Don't mean to sound self-pitying; I really, really wish I had the inner-strength and resilience of Sam.    
 What's scares me is that I have this side that I have developed over the years as a result of the abuse in my childhood and so on; I can manipulate pretty easily, guilt-trip the shit out of someone, etc. Something I learned from my mom as a kid. It scares me that I have the potential to become that...dark. There's other stuff but all in all, it just doesn't feel right to be alive. I can't see a future ahead of me but more pain, and I've lived in it for a very, very long time. I just can't seem to catch a break no matter how hard I try.

118456,"Online classes are really pissing me off!! Any Advice? Alright, so i am 16 (M) and last year, when i finished my 10th grade exams, i ended up getting 94% which is really good. I had that motivation to read well and score the same in 11th grade. But i lose all my interest due to this pathetic online classes. We students arent capable of understanding whatever the teachers are saying and the teachers are also really bad at taking classes. First few months i managed to listen a little but still wasnt good. And then later, i just started getting so distracted. I barely listen to the classes. I play Dota, or watch anime or just watch youtube but never listen to classes.

57986,"I think I'm going to kill myself in a weekunlike a lot of stories i've seen, this is not a random mood drop where nothing makes sense. this is a well thought out, month long plan in which i've tried my hardest to have good days and find a reason.

nothing makes me feel solid, no matter what, i feel like water. i feel as if i've lost everything, including myself, and maybe it all started with grief but it's morphed into this large unenjoyment of life. i can't breathe, existing hurts and it's not even that i don't have friends. i have a lot of people that worry and care for me, perhaps it's selfish to take myself away from those people but it's also selfish to assume i'm not struggling too. i suppose this makes me an awful friend and person, i just lie to them everyday. i won't even be here for the things i promise.

i want to live, yet i find not a single reason to. so i guess i'm just looking for that here, i'm too afraid to tell any of my friends what i've been planning and i feel immensely guilty for promising future things while knowing i don't think i'll even have that. i don't need a reason for life, i need a reason for MY life. i'm so tired of everything, i don't even know what day it is anymore. the only company i have is online, i'm failing my classes when i'm homeschooled and i have no passions or hobbies. i don't know what i want to do in the future, i don't think i want to do anything at all, everything is so overwhelming

i want to promise those reading that it can get better, if it's a certain event that's bringing you down you can escape it and get better. you can get help, and it's hypocritical of me to say that i guess but i do worry for you too. i'm on here to tell somebody, i want to be saved, but i can't do it myself.",depression

233066,"I just want it all to endWhere do I even begin.

I've been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years and we've been married for the past 2. My husband is living in India and we're waiting for his visa to come through. We applied in 2018 right after the wedding and we're still waiting for a decision. We've tried everything we can to get a quicker response and now they're straight up ignoring our emails.

Our relationship was perfect at the start. We understood and supported each other. I had a horrible childhood and was very depressed when I met my husband, and meeting him was the best thing that happened to me. I started flourishing at work and even became a bit more outgoing. But the longer the visa took, the worse our relationship is getting. I am snapping at the smallest of things, we're fighting almost every single day. I turned to food and Amazon for comfort and ended up gaining 20kg and my room now belongs in hoarders and my bank account is empty. In the past year, possibly the most important man in my life, my grandfather, passed away. This was the tipping point for me. Since then, I've completely shut down from my social life, I stopped caring about work, and I've lost all motivation to get up in the morning. I was traveling to India every few months over the past year and I got pregnant but had a miscarriage. I tried counseling for a while but it wasn't really helping. We had finally decided we're done waiting for the visa, and I'd quit my job and was going to travel to India in April. But then Covid happened, and I have no idea when I will be able to travel again. 

In the past few weeks, I've realised how much I've ruined my husband's life. I've been very stressed and depressed in the past year and taking it out on him. He was an extroverted, happy go lucky type of personality. I'm making him cry almost daily now. Ive ruined our relationship to the point my husband is afraid to even tell me a joke because I might take it the wrong way. And what do I do? I accuse him of being too controlling when he's just trying to help me. He's been trying to find a solution for my Amazon addiction and I'm just accusing him of taking over my finances. He's trying to help me get into a healthy routine and asking me questions to get me to communicate but I accuse him of not trusting me to do things etc. We just had an argument where he was trying to say he's just using the freedom we have over each other to help me and I just told him that since we're not living together, he has no right over me. He basically just told me he's given up. 

I hate what I've done to our relationship and to him. I hate myself for being this way. I don't want to live knowing how much I've hurt one of the few people who actually cared about me. I've come very close to slitting my wrist a few times in the past few weeks because of the constant fights (which progressively gets worse each time). Something always just stops me last minute, I guess just thinking of the pain or worried about my brother finding me(I'm living with my parents) and how it will impact him, or just worried that I'll survive and have to face everyone after. Today I had the blade to my wrist but then I just imagined all the blood and how it will be hard to cleanup for my dad and found myself looking up less messier and faster ways and found my way to this sub.",depression

I started a business years ago because I couldn't decide on a career and still question every day if this is what I should be doing.

Once a year, 30 days, no Nut. Some say that NNN was cancelled this year, due to all the challanges that 2020 has lobbed our way, and you know what I tell those people...
they are weak, they dont have what it takes to reach purity, they choose the easy path like the cowards they are.
You know, My father told me stories of what happened when you complete NNN succssfully that you transcend for a short while, and within that short while you see the human embodyments of purity and masculinity walk into the sunset, They say its a sight so beautiful that when you think of it it gives you The power to do anything.
And so bois, purity Is the key, se must remain pure and resist the temptations of the female gender although the temptations may be calling you by the name you must stand strong.
Once you complete NNN you will see the face of God and jesus will give you his touch and everything will feel amazing.
So I remind you again my compadres, dont fail this, and we will remain puré together and then in december, with the first snowfall will come The first nut. Goodluck and may God be with Is all.",non-depression
337077,"I don't know how to stop the intrusive thoughts - advice?I've had anxiety since I was about 11, because of the usual violence in the family stuff. Fast forward many years, I've been trying to hold on to jobs, but my anxiety just completely shuts me down. I'm about to get fired while on sick leave, and I keep having recurring and insistant thoughts about the best and most non-traumatizing ways (for my partner) to kill myself.

I can't shut them out. They come when I'm in bed late at night and they just latch on. I keep thinking how easy it would be in the dead of night to just do it. Most attempts of shutting them out have been to take a walk, listen to music, watch a film or pester my dogs.

They're right back when the film stops or I get a moment of silence.

Years and years of fighting my anxiety with medication and therapy and yet here I am. I have no friends, no family. The thoughts have been especially terrible these past two weeks. Maybe it doesn't help that I have mild tourettes, so keeping thoughts in check in general is difficult for me.

223525,"I want OUT!!!(New to Reddit so here goes) 

Today I woke up with extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Just like I did for years now.

My chest just keep s on hurting, my head is always humming with accusations of how dysfunctional I am.

I'm 26, currently a student and I'm failing my studies. I barely work at my job so I can work on my project, yet I'm still behind..

Even though I was supported financially by my Grandfather  I'm failing him..

I go to college almost everyday, even when there's no one in class, to work but no matter what I do it's not enough..

I come from a poor background (even now I support my mom and baby sister when I can as my mom is going through an ugly divorce, she barely takes care of herself and looks 52 at the age of 43 which freaks me out), so succeeding in my studies is important. 

My mom is no help herself, she's struggling so I can't turn to her..

My grandfather  doesn't understand the concept of depression . I once made the mistake of telling him about my suicidal thoughts..He honestly asked me is I'm insane..

I went to the psychiatrist and took anti depressants for about 3 years and suffered terribly from side effects. (Now I'm off after 1.5 years of trying to quit). 

I'm seeing a therapist  for 4 years now but when I sink in the suicide rut she seems helpless and unable to guide me out. She does a lot for me, checking in on me asking me to call her if I have thought but I can't burden her with myself on a daily basis beyond our meetings...

Even my boyfriend of 8 years is at a loss..he honestly doesn't know what to do with me anymore so he just goes through the motions. He, like the rest of the world have no time to pause for those who are frozen in place by pain and fear.

(He does try but he's not listening. Not really).

I can't turn to ER with my suicidal thought in my country in fear of being mistreated, admitted against my will and later stigmatized while looking for a job. (My therapist advised me against it for those reasons).

At college and work everyone avoids 'negative talk' and I always have to smile and mask myself. To the question ""How are you"" there is only one valid answer and it's always positive. Honestly, will people please stop asking if the don't wish to know? It's not as polite as our culture teaches.

I've been battling with this since age 8. I'm very tired. I really can't go on like this! this has to stop one way or another.

I need a guide. An actual guide. I don't want people to ""be there for me"" while passively holding my hand and feeling sorry for me.

I need someone to tell me how to get out of this black hole! Instructions! 

I cannot keep self harming just to get by day by day! 

Thank you for letting me share",depression
167446,"I see no other way outSorry for the long post but I’m scared with how I am feeling! 

I’ve tried believe me I have tried. To start with I was bullied very badly at school and ended up leaving with no qualifications hardly as I hated school but I’m not a stupid guy. I went to college (age 16 UK) and completely transformed myself. I made loads of friends, oddly most of them went to my past school lol. I went out with them all the time drinking and it’s still the best time of my life, I was so popular. Then my grandma died and I don’t think I’ve ever recovered. Bless her but it was the worst possible time it could of happened. All these friends were not there for me and I slumped even deeper. 

I came out of it again when I was 18 when I got a girlfriend but she cheated on me in 2 weeks. I was still ok and began to get friends again but nothing really ever took off. I’m still a virgin now and I’m 26, not really bad looking and I’m in good shape as well. Between the ages of 20-24 I literally did nothing. I had 2 operations in that time and just worked, I’ve been getting worse and worse though since I was 18 and I’m just going to get even worse. 

I quit my job 5 months ago for a lot of reasons. I dated my childhood friend within that time. She said she liked me but wasn’t in the right frame of mind and she was at university a lot so she said she didn’t want a relationship. I got drunk for 4 days straight and it ended in a breakdown with my parents consoling me. My dad said I could beat it and that’s what I’ve been trying so hard to do. I’ve got fit and healthy, went to the doctors and applied for over 200 jobs and I’ve finally got one. 

I just don’t feel ready at all, today was my first day and it was awful. I couldn’t motivate myself and I was really tired. The job is awful just taking rolls of fabric off a conveyor belt. My boss kept asking me if I was ok and it was doing my head in. I can’t stand the job but I can’t quit again. I told my parents I hated it but I’m going to stay. I can’t get any other job this is the best I can get. I try so hard with everything yet my life is awful. I don’t see the point anymore. Why carry on if I hate life so much, it’s just not for me. My first day drove me insane nearly and I’m staying. I won’t kill my self because a lot of people will miss me and I would never want to upset them like that. But I’m living a nightmare. I am depressed, stressed, anxious and a nervous wreck around everybody. I haven’t been able to concentrate on anything for 2 years. I made mistakes today and I didn’t give a crap I just let them happen, I wouldn’t care if they sacked me I am not fit for work. I just wanted to disappear today. I don’t care at all anymore.

I have never known how to make new connections so thats not really an option because of my crippling social anxiety lol. Its my birthday soon, im going to get a lot of money. I know where i can buy a gun and i think thats what ill spend it on. I have Multiple personality disorders, i dont mean i have *a* multiple personality disorder. Anyways, been thinking of suicide every single day without failure for at least 8 years. Somedays its for a moment, other days its for a week. I always knew i would die young, and i accepted that young too. Im not afraid of death at all so im not really scared. My plan is to run away, then shoot myself in the ocean, hopefully i wont be found and people will just think i ran away. A pistol is surprisingly cheap tbh. I have zero idea of what i want in a career so i dont care about that. My only dream is to make music and be successful enough to live off that. Thats not likely to happen since i know many artists who are extremely talented but just dont have the ""clout"" or attention so they earn peanuts for their work. I dont want to live broke, or even decent, i wont be satisfied until im rich. Again not likely. Started therapy recently. Its shit. They dont help. Just ask a bunch of questions then say ""maybe you will need to have a different type of therapy but im not sure yet"". I dont trust anyone. I come across as self centred and  narcissistic. These problems ive had my whole life. Nothing *really* changes.  Anyway i know right now im not depressed enough to kill myself and thats okay ill wait until my birthday where literally no one will say happy birthday to me im sure that will do it. Life isnt that bad actually (relatively speaking) , im just sure not living it would be better. Lol i ramble too much. My own parents didn't love me, none of my five siblings does either. Every time ive gotten close to having a partner i push them away because i know at the time they only seen the side of me i wanted them to see. I cant break their heart like that so id rather be alone. Sometimes physical pain is the only thing i can feel, but going my whole life cutting or burning myself sounds kind of boring. I wasnt brought up with any kind of faith just a single ""parent"" who fostered me, started speaking to god this year, i can tell he has abandoned me too because of some stupid and ignorant decisions on my behalf.

212700,"(dont read if youre feeling fragile) How can i treat addiction, self destruction and depression?I've had 3 therapists through out the 2 years ive seeked treatment. 1 said she wasnt qualified to deal with my specific issues, the other took maternity leave and the other i chose to stop seeing but he said since my mood has been very low for however many weeks in a row it was he wouldve suggested i switch anyway the next week. I got the feeling far too often i was being lied to and actually burrowing deeper into depression. comments about acceptance (just accept im a miserable person with an extremely difficult life basically) and especially comments on why i should believe in god or free will convince me im hopeless. not gonna get into god but free will is disproved (in brief, for more in depth see my last post) like this: free will = doing what you want but you dont chose what you want. people will say things to addicts like youve got to want to get better. that reduces simply it to wanting to get better more than wanting to feed the addiction. again wanting to want sobriety in and of itself is no choice and your level of success is dependent on how much you want it, everyone admits this but no one connects the dots. i still try to get better but i dont really have any hope. i feel like i just self destruct in every scenario which makes happiness feel impossible.

anyway it seems like everybody who has an addiction takes some fucked up delusional belief in god or karma or something. they insist on thinking positive for it own sake but if youre choosing your thoughts based on how they make you feel rather than how true they are it seems like obvious conscious delusion. treatment always seems to include ""removing limiting beliefs"" but that just seems wrong. im only interested in removing false beliefs. if the truth is, which it may not be, that ill never be happy id want that thought to fester till i take the only appropriate response, suicide. the thing is i feel like my therapists tried to get me to believe in god because i have no real reason to live. you dont lie to a person who has a good life, they lied to me.

i think ill probably never get better but i know its possible. i just never want to achieve it by lying to myself and taking drugs everyday. the idea taking drugs 24/7 will help me see the world more clearly seems like an obvious lie. therapists seem like a mirage of hope on the horizon promising it gets better when it wont, just waiting till im sad enough to cave. i dont think there is hope for anyone who hates them-self at their core

about me is that I am stupid.

I cannot even live my own life without the help of my mother; I am a fucking 35 year old unemployed, kissless, virgin, man-child. Having been scared of people for all my life, I have no clue about building friendships and relationships. I am passive, and a mute; I want to speak, but I cannot speak since I can't remember much, and speaking causes anxiety, stress and exhaustion. 

I want to say that I want to live my life, but all I want to do is to live /a/ life. And even with that discount, I do not know how to /live/.

People tell me to learn things, but I do not know how to learn. Mistakes bring breakdowns; coping with those nervous fallouts leave me with very little chance of learning. Instead of learning how to build a relationship, my go-to choice is to live without a relationship.

It is heart-breaking to see people marrying, having kids and families. I see people talk, and I am unable to understand the reason they need to talk. Why the fuck does my mind want intimate experiences on one had, and then draw a blank on the other when asked the reason for talking?

But I didn't realize that at first as I was on my phone. My father called my mother and they were talking about some unnecessary things as always. Then they switched the topic to me and that's when it started.

My mother told my father that she absolutely can't stand me anymore. I behave like a 10 year old, asking her for hugs and not wanting to be alone in my room because I'm so lonely. 
I quickly realized that she didn't know I was in the room but I didn't say anything as I wanted to know what more she woul say. Big mistake.

She then went on to tell him that I always threaten her by saying that I don't want to live anymore. (I do this because I have noone else to tell this to and it kills me, ABSOLUTELY kills me when I can't talk to someone about this)
She tells him that she just wished I would kill myself so she wouldn't have to listen to my stupid ugly voice anymore.

(I have an unusually deep voice for being female and my ex-bestfriends always were shaming me for it)

She then started to cry and was really aggressively telling my father all the ways she wanted to see me dead. 

I should be hanging in my room from the ceiling.

I should be a mess of blood splattered on the ground after being driven over by a car or train.

I should be lying in my bed dead after having taken thousands of pills.

I'm going to spare you more details but she was very, very aggressively detailed about telling my father the ways in which I should die. 

My father, I guess, agreed to her or didn't try to stop her atleast. He hates me a lot. (He abused me for over 10 years)

At that point I felt the panic attack coming and didn't hear what else she was saying. She hung up soon after that.

I sat there for a couple of minutes, afraid what she would do to me when she found out, I heard her. I then quickly ran out of the room, up the stairs and smashed my door shut and put my chair infront of the door because I could already hear her screaming.

I'm absolutely terrified. I'm broken. I thought she was the only one I could trust and talk to (even though I knew she hated me from the way she always talked to me before) but now it's real. This is reality. This really just happened. Help me please. I want to kill myself so bad. I am suicidal again since 3 weeks and this week has been going ok, I thought I could finally go back to school again and forget about suicide but this just shattered me.

Don’t get me wrong, I have an incredible partner, who despite enjoying pushing my buttons to a limit of anger, I adore. He’s so so supportive and is definitely millions of miles above anyone else I have ever been with. 

I guess my reason for writing this today, is because I just found my restraining order. I was raped in my sleep 4 years ago, and it was finally over last year. Or so I thought. I have recently found out he is trying to appeal against his sentence as he and another judge believes the sentence was “too long”. All I ever hear from people around me is that I should be lucky that I got “justice” from what happened. But, how can anyone justify justice? It’s different for each person. No amount of years in prison is going to take away the damage, the mental instability or the fact I want to die every single day. 

I guess I’m just genuinely not happy with my life. It’s one thing after another and I always promise myself it will get better but it never does.

You can think of me as a snowflake, but I don’t think that children at the age of 9 should know about sex, PTSD, and/or torture. Some parents are irresponsible and will allow children below the age recommendation watch films like this.

267573,"Thinking Of Taking A Huge Investment Gamble, If I Fail Then I Kill Myself. If I Succeed, Then That's All Good.So I've been trading/gambling in crypto currency since April 2017. My biggest success came in August 2017, after investing $30k in a project called Binance Coin. My investment grew to a September 2017 high of $160k. That's a lot of money for me. The price crashed in mid September 2017. If I didn't sell my Binance Coins when the price crashed, I would have had $500k now. Enough money to resign from the job that I hate, and be financially free in some way.

When the Binance Coin price temporarily crashed in mid September 2017, I lost the plot completely. Long story short, I have now lost a total of $70k because I chased other coins so I can get back the $160k. I lost all my life savings in the process. My pension fund is gone, I've lost everything. I have zero savings, and I owe a lot of money. I owe a $55k mortgage, and a $5k credit card debt. Luckily for me, I don't have children. But I'm old, i.e. 34 years old. 

My 8 year old car is starting to give in, and I am literally one salary away from poverty.

I'm desperate, and I'm at a point where I'm considering taking out a $25k loan, and invest it in a project that I believe will succeed. If it fails, then I will kill myself. If it succeeds, then my life will be back on track.

She quietly left a few minutes after that and I just... laid in bed and realized that I'm really going to hurt her, another friend, and my parents at the absolute least. So I drank water. I read a post here about how we think people love us out of obligation, but in reality they know perfectly well they aren't forced to stay here yet they do anyway, waiting for us to grow back into a healthy person. I really hate how good of a friend she is, and I hurt because I know not everyone has that person in their life. I don't know what I will do but I've never gotten professional help, so I should probably check off seeing a therapist before killing myself.

4936,"I'm really not sure what I'm going to do.I'm 23 years old. I've had issues with self harm since I was 11, depression since 14, anxiety since 15. I've long been called paranoid, but started noticing serious paranoia in the last six months or so. I've been in a bad mental state since about November.

It doesn't help that I've just graduated, thus losing a job and moving away from most of my friends and my ex. It doesn't help that I'm living with my parents and have been unable to house or feed myself, much less find a job or a place of my own. It doesn't help that my ex and I broke up about a week and a half ago. But none of these are the reason I'm depressed or suicidal.

I've never seriously attempted suicide, but feeling suicidal is unfortunately very familiar to me. I have done reckless things that had the potential to kill me several times, knowing I could die and not caring whether I did or not. (It is mostly luck that I am still here.) I know that I'm not just going to get better from this and go on to live a normal, healthy, happy life. I know that it's possible -- probable, even -- that I will commit suicide. I don't believe I will live to see 25. 

I'm not ready to die, I don't really want to die. I'm too sad and too scared to go into nothingness alone. It would hurt my family too much if I died. But I feel like suicide is something I should do, whether I want to or not. I feel like it is inevitable. 

I want to get better, be happy, succeed at something. Or I want to want to. But I don't believe it's possible.

I saw a psychologist today, and felt marginally better. I have appointments with her on Monday and Thursday, and an appointment with a psychiatrist on Friday. 

I have no intention of acting any time soon, and it would take more effort to prepare things than I currently have anyway. I really don't want to die. But I also know that I have had at least one plan and the means to carry it out for years now. I know that I have had pretty much the same suicide note planned out for years, and used to carry it in my wallet. I know I meet an awful lot of the warning signs.

Sometimes, the thought of death comforts me. Mostly it scares me. I go back and forth on whether I really want to die, even though I know I don't have the guts to do it. Sometimes I can distract myself for a while and even laugh, or make abstract plans about the future (e.g. wanting to grow my hair long, or learn vegetarian cooking). That seems really weird to me, and it's distressing sometimes that I can go back and forth between happiness/hope (even if they're false) and despair so quickly and frequently. But I can't really ever forget or deny that I am seriously ill and have been for a long time, and that I probably always will be.

im 20 years old. ive always been healthy, went to the gym often and what not. very active and usually full of life, albeit not a social butterfly. earlier this year i was basically at my prime. happy, finally having a social life, going out with friends, fuckin girls. until 5 months ago i countered a yeast infection because i was too stupid to wear condoms. i'm supposed i'm std free. so i go to this doctor , who very, very stupidly prescribes me a strong steroid cream to put on my penis. she told me it would heal the infection faster. i thought ok great. so i use it for only a week, half the time i was told to use it, because eventually i looked up this cream and found out that you should never put that shit down there. i was shocked that this happened to me. i'm a statistic now. the steroid cream not only ruined my skin there, but it fucked with all of the vessels. the cream strongly constricted them, and as a result they are a lot weaker and i have damaged veins as well so i can't get proper erections any more. they are even painful now. i only applied the cream to my head, but this cream was so strong it reached all over my genitals parts of my pelvis. to paint an ugly picture, i now have a red burnt looking dick and red balls/genital area, with sensitive enlarged blood vessels all around. 

basically there's no cure for this. i've looked and tried every possible thing, but these past couple months i've just given up. to make things worse for me, i can't even enjoy weed anymore because i guess since my vessels are damaged it aggravates them, since thc opens vessels. i'm literally in tons of pain if i try to smoke. i use to be a big pothead, that's how people knew me. that was my thing, my escape, my means of bonding with friends, my way of treating my anxiety.

i'm just not happy anymore. my happiness and outlets (sex, weed, even masturbation) were robbed from me because of a dumb bitch ""doctor"".  i'm pretty depressed ever since this happened, and my problem down there seems to be getting worse instead of healing. i'm just fuckin done with this nightmare. i'm tired living like this. i've been wanting to end it all since this happened, but now i think i'm coming pretty close to actually doing it. so yeah here's my rant, hope this made some of you realize that you're not as fucked up as you think",depression

232201,"Friend is in a poor family stateThis is a developing topic right now, but my friend has just told me that   his current living situation is extremely stressful where his mother the other family members to extreme lengths. I can't describe in detail, but recently he has been feeling depressed, resulting in low performance in school after years of perfection. He informed me that his mom has been taking away many of his privileges (which he has been using to keep himself going through depression) such as his laptop, phone, curfew. Upon confrontation to tell his parents how he feels, things escalated resulting in his mom hitting him for the first time in his life. He describes that the family is completely disjointed and dysfunctional where he cannot reason with anyone to seek help. I've advised him to seek help of the school guidance counselor in order to bring these massive issues to higher levels, including his doctor (whom he cannot access through means of his parents) and a family counselor. What he is worried about is that guidance (as mandatory reporters) will report his mom to the police, which is not what he wants as he believes it will destroy the family beyond recovery and he believes she will not touch him again. He tells me that he has no relatives or family friends reasonably close. Some of the closest members of our group live very close to him with whom he could physically run to for help if it came to that (which I wanted for him to do tonight), but he wants to keep this between the two of us unless worst comes to worst. I have made myself and my home an availability to him, but again this would require me telling my parents, something he doesn't want to happen.

As of now, he feels safe inside his home, but I am worried for him still and am seeking advice to give him as he is not comfortable/ able to advocate for himself in person.",depression

*stares at the blinking cursor*

I'll start with this then. I have social anxiety disorder, this kinda makes life a bit difficult with it usually involving other people haha.
I was too scared and embarrassed to call the suicide hotline, so here I am, afraid that I'm going to hurt myself.

I used to think that I had everything I needed, a future, a relationship with my best friend *(side note: It's a long distance relationship)*, and enthusiasm for basically everything.
Until my best friend broke up with me, more than once. The first time she broke up with me wrecked me emotionally. I threw up, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, and I was alone. The reason she broke up with me was because she couldn't handle being in a relationship that made her happy (a bit more on that later). So she blocked me on every messaging platform. We weren't **that** serious back then, we never even said ""I love you"" to each other.

So a month went by and I tried to deal with the breakup, which I wasn't doing very well. And suddenly I get this message from her. Nothing special, but it fills me with a bit of hope. Lo and behold, this message turns into us getting into a relationship again. Only this time more serious. We didn't FaceTime before because of my social anxiety, but I slowly started to make an exception. We felt comfortable, everything was going great. We talked about everything, and we both supported each other.

The reason she broke up with me because of that is because of her issues. She has some family issues that messed with her psychological and emotional development, which means that the 'best' way for her to deal with things in her eyes is to push everything away.

I started to get used to her 'breaking up' with me all the time, she apologized after her episodes, and we moved on. But only after she blocked me a million times. I think the way she did it and kept saying ""goodbye"" scarred me for life.

We started saying ""I love you"" too each other. It was the best feeling I've ever felt, looking into her beautiful eyes (even if it's through FaceTime) and telling her that I love her (and of course her saying it back). Plans were made, dates were set. The long distance part hurt, but it was all going to be okay. A plane ticket costs basically nothing and when I turned 18, we would be able to live together.

This was of course all ruined by my now former drug addict friend. He's still a drug addict.

He kept fueling my now ex about how bad I am and how she should break up with me. This of course were the drugs talking, but she didn't know that and thought ""he actually knows him so it much be true"". This combined with her issues didn't end well for us. She trashed me, called me every bad word in and out of the dictionary, and pretended that everything was okay while wreaking havoc on everything around her. So she broke up with me, blocked me, and immediately moved in with some loser. But only after pretending to say I love you to manipulate me into saying something to her.

This was half a year ago. My former friend has since then apologized for his behavior (after denying everything) before returning back to his drugs.

My dad tells me that she will eventually realize that she's unhappy with the loser she moved in with and go back to me. 99% of the things he says are true. I can't live without her. Everything I do feels useless without her and I miss her so much. Sometimes she still texts me to say that she's depressed, asking for help, saying that she misses me. She also tells me to fuck off after that.

The pain only increases the more time goes by. My dad keeps saying that everything will be okay and that I just have to wait for her, but it's been half a year. I'm going crazy here.

There was also something about being semi-engaged to her, but I honestly don't know where to put that now.

We met in 2015 and I instantly thought she was cool. I don't know what to do without her.

That's about 1/3 of it. Phew, venting kinda made me feel a little better.

Life is just a chore that drones by way too fast some days and way too slow others.  One thing always remains the same - it's all pointless.  Nothing can be done.  Nothing can be accomplished.  Always a reason I can't do things.  Must be nice to be born into a family that actually gives a shit about you, has the finances to make sure you have a shot at a real life, has parents actually around to teach you things.  must be real nice.  I can only fantasize about what life might have been had I been born into a real and worthwhile situation instead of being some kids' bad mistake.

fucking...26 now, and nothing is worth anything.  Nothing is interesting.  Nothing is fun.  Nothing is clever.  Everything is boring.  There's nothing remotely interesting to do.  I have a dying creative side that I can't do anything with because I don't have the money to do anything with it.  I also don't have any talents.

Eventually I'm just going to die and not exist anymore - rendering absolutely anything I could have done pointless anyway.  What's the point to live just to die?  I don't understand religious people - it's so fucking obvious and blatant that we're just some shit organism that grew on a rock and will cease to exist like everything else.  How the fuck are people so stupid that they'll believe in magic and fairy tales in which they don't even have evidence for?  All that shit does is make the time we do have worse.

I'm angry at everything, all the time.  Everything annoys me.  Nothing is pleasurable.  I eat begrudgeonly when my body won't stop demanding it.  It's expensive and feels like shit going through me.  So fucking tired of spending money.  Fucking tired of earning money.  day in, day out, same fucking bullshit.  Nothings different it's all just material bullshit.

run the fucking retardrace in hopes that some wealthy fucking fuck will throw you a pittance and call you a good boy so that you can eat and live another day just to waste it all at his fucking whim.  Hey, it's his kid's futures you're working so hard for, isn't it?  They need to know what a life without conflict or work or problems are.  Fucking rich pieces of privileged shit.

Unfortunately I couldn't even be born a gender seen worthwhile in humanity's eyes.  Nobody likes a man.  A man is scary, dangerous, creepy, gross, expendable, trash, a lapdog for women.    Fodder for the women and children and the wealthy.  Fight and die in wars they start so they can live happy and without conflict.  Fuck them. fuck people.  fuck all people.  why should i give a fuck about anyone anymore?

There's only one thing left i want to do, and that's to die fucking gloriously.  i'm going to drink until i can barely stand, on a rooftop, and shoot my fucking brains off while fireworks shoot from my body.  Maybe I'll crush some asshole on the way down.",depression

189619,"I'm severely depressed and have no where to go but end it all...I give up and the only people I have left don't give a shit about me. I'm just the checkMy mom is dead, my dad is an abusive ass so I live with my grandparents. I have no friends or anyone to talk to. I'm alone. No one cares about me. These people I call family just see me as a way to get money. I'm 19 and I wanna get my drivers license but I can't, they won't let me. They told me I'd have to get my own car to learn how to drive but I can't. You kinda need your license or permit to buy a car and drive it home right? I dont even have my damn permit and all I ask Is for a little help so i can buy my own. Not only that but I haven't started to build up my credit. I tried asking them how I can do that without having a credit card and they pushed me aside or act like I'm dumb

But what pisses me off more is that they gave my brother a fucking brand new car and helped him get his licence at my age. They helped my sister with college but when it comes to me they treat me like an outsider. They won't let me have any friends. I lost friends because of them. Why is it that they help everyone else in the family but me? Aren't I apart of the family too? 

Today me and my grandpa got into an argument and he told me ""you know, that your nothing more than a nuisance to me"" but I just paid 200 bucks for groceries for them and have been every month along with giving them 300 dollars for rent. So really? I over heard my grandparents talking one day about how they don't expect me to succeed In life. I'm only 19, I'm living off the government and not by my choice (I'd like to get off this damn social security bull shit so I can have a normal life and normal job.), I watch as they help everyone else but they won't lift a finger to help me, I wanna go to college but the closest one is a long drive away and they refuse to drive me there not only that but no buses so I got a bike but It mysteriously broke, and I don't have a car to do what I need to do. Anyone I can ask to help me get my license live in another state. I get that I'm only 19 but I'm gonna be 20 in a few days. I asked if my grandpa could find me a used car and I'd pay but he refuses, says that if I find a car it'd be out of my league are too nice of a car for me to have. My grandpa brought home a car free from a junk yard that has no engine, tires, or brakes and said this is more in your league. The car was falling apart. I think he did it as a joke but that's not funny. 

I talked about why they felt like I wouldn't succeed in life and they said it's cause I don't help them out enough and that I'm stupid. Their exact words were ""You don't help us out enough. Thank you for rent and food but we need more out of you. You're just useless to us without your socal security and we just don't see you having a great life. We fear that you'll end up like your mother one day, like a failure. We hate to belittle you but do you really think someone like you getting a degree and a driver's license will really help you get somewhere in life. Don't hold your breath, like we said your useless and stupid. Anything you try to accomplish would be a waste of time. We need you to stay with us cause you help us out. What do you think would happen if you left us? If you havent thought about that your dumber then we thought."" I don't feel loved by these people but maybe their right. It's like they just want me to stay here so they can use me. I don't mind helping out, but that's all I do. All I do is help but get nothing more in return, not that I expect it but every now and then would be nice. Maybe a little of a happy birthday would be awesome too. Every year they forget about mine but they call my brother and sister Marcy on their birthdays. Me and my brother are twins so it's not like It's an honest mistake they just favor him.

Maybe I should just end it all. Like my grandpa said I'm just a nuisance. If I died today who'd help pay bills and buy groceries? I'm stupid and useless to them right? What else do I have besides them? All my friends they chased away. I doubt they'd care if I died. I'm alone and not even my own family cares about me. I'm just being used. I feel trapped unable to leave the nest. Unable to grow up And be a normal functioning human. I'm almost 20 for gods sake, I wanna be free. I wanna have a college degree and spit in their face for thinking that I'll never be able to succeed...but how can I do this when they won't even give me the chance or at least a benefit of a doubt.
I only wanna die now.",depression

I don’t go out with people often. I hang out with my friends occasionally, but mostly at school. For reference, we have had the same friend group for 5 YEARS. We know everything about each other and talk everyday at school.

And guess what.

5 days ago, it was my friend’s birthday. I had gotten him a gift card for Xbox because that’s all he spends his money on. I gave it to him in the morning at school and he thanked me.

I asked my other friend if he would be on Xbox tonight. His response: I’m going to a party tonight sorry. I said okay and that was that.

Cut to that night, I get a  Snapchat notification from my friend from his story. Turns out that they all went out to dinner.

Guess who didn’t get invited.

They know I have been struggling with anxiety. I have never dated a single girl, hell, even talking to one could give me an anxiety attack.

And yet they do this. I know you guys will tell me to talk to them about it, but I would literally meltdown from anxiety. They are the only friends I’ve ever had. I’m dead serious.Along with a lot of issues at home, I’m at my breaking point. I’m not a downer at all, when I’m at school I act pretty normal, just quiet. I just can’t see why it was me that wasn’t there.

211631,"College Dropout Contemplating Ending It AllI've already gone through this all before. A few years ago in college I went through a rough breakup. I lost all my friends and was forced to see my ex being happy, going out, etc. My summer was spent in my secluded redneck town with no job prospects and no way to get out. I was trapped. Every day I broke down a little more until I was seriously contemplating suicide just to get away. She was off having fun, finishing college, etc. And I was wasting my days away living with my mother with no option to escape.

I struggled through it. I went through every agonizing day working on myself. I realized it wasn't the girl that made me want to end it. It was my individual failures. I was just using her as a crutch. I spent the next two years getting over her and improving my life situation. I made new friends, learned to be happy independently, and enrolled back in school.

Everything was going fine until I was kicked out of college unjustly for reasons I can't dig into here. I had to embarrassingly pack my things and return home 2 weeks into the new semester. I had almost completed my degree. But I lost everything and wasted 3 years of my life.

I spent the next year back in my hometown. I stumbled onto a temporary warehouse job. I had to drive 1 hour each way everyday in blizzards for a miserable $8/hr job. But it gave me a temporary purpose and some money for when I was able to return to school whenever that my be. The rest of my year was spent living in an unhappy situation at home with a mother who was no doubt secretly embarrassed at my daily routine of being a useless leech living at home in my early 20's.

I finally got a chance at a new start last year. I packed my things and headed off to a new school. I made many new friends. I had girls chasing me for a date. My grades were excellent. I was in a major that I loved and a school I loved. I was barely scraping by financially but I was making it. And it was worth it.

But now my car finally kicked the bucket. It sounds petty and stupid. But I was barely making it by. Now I can't go back. I just don't have the money. All my stuff is there. The added costs of a new vehicle, flying back, etc. are just too much. I loved it there. And every day I realize I just can't afford to go back. Everything I worked and waited for. My fresh start flushed down the drain.

I just can't go through that type of depression again. It was a hard fought battle that took several years of my life. I'm 20some years old. I'm $40K in debt from student loans. I can't waste more years living in my mother's house with no job, no education, and no hope. Not again.",depression

Life is so terribly annoying. I've attempted suicide 3 times when I was younger (I'm in my 20s now) and every time I think about how much I failed I get so pissed. But this time won't be the case! Compared to my last 3 attempts (and their reasonings behind them) this one will most definitely be success because of several reasons:


1) I've actually been more thoughtful about how I am planning on doing it (All my earlier attempts were by impulse)

2) My reason for wanting to kill myself now is more I would say ""mature"" compared to when I attempted before. To put it shortly, I realized that because of my circumstances in life and how fucked society and the world is, life is just going to be most likely shitty for me in the long run. I don't want to get older and constantly suffer with this shitty reality and how fucking idiotic and fucked up society that invalidates your hard work unless you're the ideal person because if you're not, of course your hard work means nothing!

3) It just have to happen at this point. Failure can't be an option, getting caught can't be an option.

4) I was suppose to kill myself around this time last year. I was so dead on doing it, I didn't have a thoroughly thought out plan but I was getting prepared for it. Unfortunately, my plan went fucking downhill. 


So because I was ready to die I started becoming more careless with my classes (also my GRE scores came out terrible that I just really needed to kill myself soon) that my professor for one of my classes had a meeting with me telling me that I might have to drop the class if I don't show up more. So I had an emotional breakdown about feeling suicidal in her office (I'm honestly open about me being suicidal because I would rather have people I know be aware of it so when it happens its not a shocker to people). She actually ended up forcing me to take therapy at our university (she even requested the therapist and all that). 


So I've been in therapy ever since and nothing has changed and honestly at times my therapist got somewhat emotional over my resistance to give up wanting to kill myself. I don't want medication because I just don't see the point and honestly I like my mental state and who I am as a person too much to risk changing that to feel less suicidal. Plus hearing from others experience it just seems like it will suck.


So technically I could have been killed myself because who cares about being forced into therapy? I can still kill myself if I want! 


So even after getting therapy I was still hell bent on killing myself but because my professor intervened I decided to just lay low about it until I had everything ready to. So while ""waiting"" I decided to just say ""fuck it"" and have some sort of fun before I killed myself and started using tinder seriously (I only really used for the fun of swiping). So this attractive guy actually ends up talking to me and asks me to come over and spend the night at his house. As sketchy it sounded to me at first I went ahead cause fuck it why not (and honestly if he ended being a nut case or something I would of been okay with getting killed, terrible I know lol). 


I wished I never did, it was the best experience I ever had in my life. So because I didn't give a shit about living I pretty much walked in with no expectations of what would happened and I didn't really care. We ended up having sex like six times! It was a really big deal to me because that was when I realized why sex is so important. I wasn't a virgin but my first was the shittiest at sex and was just a piece of shit in general (actually one of the reasons for my 2nd attempt) and was the last person I had sex with which was 2 years before I had sex with the other guy.


So after the first hook up I was just like ""oh man that was so good"" but I still was planning to kill my self because again, I didn't really care and I was expecting him to not really contact me afterwards. So all was still planned for me to end it.


Except not, we've actually been fuck buddies for over a year now and it's really interfering with my plan to kill myself. It's like holy shit sex with him is amazing and it keeps getting better that nowadays if I'm not having suicidal thoughts I'm having sexual thoughts about sex with him. It's fucking terrible because I think it's stupid to solely depend on hedonistic pleasure for giving you meaning in life. Like seriously every time I have a that impending thought to seriously kill myself whoosh! He hits me up we fuck and I'm happy as a bean for a good week or two. 


I can't do this anymore there is no point to this. I've thought about ending things with him but I can't because there's no reason to other than I just want to be able to kill myself! He's a cool guy and he's great in bed, and even when we have disagreements he apologizes when he's wrong so it's like....fuck he's not even that shitty of a person to drop. D:


So I'm planning on killing myself in December once I see whether my research project was accepted to this conference next year. If my fuck buddy ends things with me before that, that would be better so then I can just kill myself with more ease but I don't see that happen any time soon.


But man every day I just feel like I need to just be like fuck it and just kill myself already. I'm just such a mess. :S",depression

Point is they are all pretty vocal about suicide, I'm not.Most if not all of those who sre have committed self-harm(and were open about showing theyr wounds) and I have not(cause I see no point in it.I don't want pain, I want it to end).

583,"Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now. 

Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. 

I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. 

I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their ""antidepressant."" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. 

They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). 

They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: 

SO: I want to die 

me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight? 

SO: I'm already hurting myself 

me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How? 

SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both. 

A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/""end my suffering""/""end me"" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a ""nerd"" or told ""stop worrying about me"" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with ""what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?"" 

That message honestly made me sick to my stomach. 

I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. 

What should I do, you guys? I don’t know what is going on, I don’t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I don’t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I don’t know if I should stay with them if this continues—not because they have depression, but because they won’t address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. 
We’ve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but I’m not an antidepressant. I’m a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really don’t want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.

162645,"The only way is to have never existed.Another entry while I'm in this deepening pit.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel bitter towards everything, and the specific people who could have helped but just sat back and watched and laughed, cringed, avoided, assumed I was autistic or something (I'm not apparently). But even when I think back to when there could have been an intervention - by a school, ""loved one"", doctor etc. - it feels like it \*still\* would have been too late. I want a hug so badly (ideally from a mother-figure who isn't a cunt,) but I know it wouldn't help. I want someone to tell me I have something to live for and that I deserve to live like I love myself, but again I can't see that changing anything at this point. Services that provide counsellors/therapists to ""help"" just sound like cogs in the machine now. 

I clearly am not fit for that phenomenon where people overcome their issues and have fulfilling lives where they can help others by being the adult they needed growing up. I truly cannot see myself as a content person, because then it's like I would be going against the grain of who I really am. I can only imagine myself dying asap or spending my life spiralling in god knows how many directions, and wasting resources that more functional people can use. I'm too tired, too bitter, too sad to give a shit about anything. 

Pity doesn't work either, which may seem weird since I'm posting here. I just wanted my thoughts 'out there'. Funny that the best moments of the great ""uni experience"" so far has been me drowning in wine and vodka by myself. I can't wait to leave these naive idiots thinking that there are good people out there who don't abuse children.

So, if you read another of my posts, you'd know that I am a 15 year old in Highschool, just to clear things up.

I am tired of using a ghetto facade all the time. I always have to act ghetto to everyone in school, just to hide the weak, shy and quiet pussy hiding inside.

Hell, the only reason I have as many friends as I do is because of the way I act around people. But of course, my facade has flaws. Whenever, like, a teacher or other adult comes near me, or when my parents are around, it's back to the real, piece of shit version of me.

263006,"Here are two good reasons not to kill yourself:Because if you survive attempts (and even the powerful feelings/fantasies/plans), you are better equipped to help others. By far, most people who kill themselves are good souls, sensitive people, empathic. Their depression might bring out responses that make them not value this inner goodness (e.g. apathy that decays into nihilism, defensiveness, anger, even aggression), but the good decent core is still there. If there's less of you/us out there in the world, then the world misses out on that; that's a huge loss to the universe. Don't let the bad/cold/indifferent guys win.
I'm sure I would care about you and even love you and see the good and wonderful within you even if you don't love yourself. Unfortunately here in the metaverse there is no way I can reach out and hug you there in that dark existential corner you've dwelt in too often / too long.
Postscript: I successfully talked three friends out of suicide in the last 14 mos. In each case, they trusted me because I've survived four major attempts (overdoses and one carbon monoxide). Learning how to forgive yourself and not sabotaging yourself with self-hatred/loathing is vital to fighting off those suicidal feelings/thoughts.

My college has no open parties and I never get invited to any. No one texts me asking me if I want to talk or hang out. I cry all the time because no one wants me, and whenever I cry, I make sure nobody hears me. Not because I fear I'll get attention, but because I fear no one will care. I cut myself in the shower a few days ago. What gets me even more than the people who never talk to me are the ones that reach out to me once, then disappear. Like that one friend I texted. In the year and a half I've been diagnosed with depression, I tried everything. I was hospitalized three times, went to counseling once a week, and took three different kinds of antidepressant meds plus two mood stabilizers. Nothing ever worked. The only way I can ever feel better is to be accepted like everybody else or die, and I'm sure the former will never happen.

This time around, the calm only lasted 4 days. I was so excited to have my life back that I set up plans and dates to catch up with friends and go to the gym. I usually have a month or two of living normally before the depression hits again, but this time I only got four fucking days. 

I tried to help myself by trying to recreate the circumstances that lead my out of depression, but I know it's not the way to go and is just killing me in other ways. When I don't eat, I'm happy. I'm starting to think it's less because of the control over my body and more because my body can't be fucked feeling sad when it's starved. So really, depressed or not, I'm slowly killing myself. 

I know I try to be positive and logical on this board but I am so frustrated and defeated right now. I'm honestly struggling to see the point in continuing any further. I lie in bed and my heart beats so slowly and my breathing is so shallow, it feels like I'm already dying. It's to the point where I'm posting here and I'm not begging for help, I'm just giving in and throwing my thoughts out. I'm so tired, everyone. I'm sorry and tired. 

I just don't see a point anymore. Despite how many times I've told myself that this storm will pass, that this ugliness is temporary and not my fault, it doesn't stop the emotional and physical toll of depression. It doesn't soften the blow anymore. It may pass but I don't want it to come back. It might not be my fault but that doesn't stop it from hurting me and the people I love. 

When I get thoughts of suicide, I always look to my motivation board and then go to my room where there are no objects that can aid in suicide to tempt me. But today is different. I'm in my room, on my bed staring at the ceiling. But everything around me looks tempting. I've cleaned my room and made it tidy in a bid to busy myself, but it's more like I've dressed it so that when my family comes home, it's not as disheveled and messy.

I'm really, really sick of living. I'm 19 years old. For 11 years I've tried to find a way out of this so called ""life"". Maybe it just wasn't meant for me. 

My life was never there to support me. I was an accident so it's normal I guess. I have a little brother, that one was planned, and my older sister is kinda succesful now, so favoritism is expected.

Never had my parents sit down and talk to me. Father was certainly free to spend his hard earned money in stuff for everyone and booze. Of course, I only got stuff when he wanted me to shut up. Mother said she loved me, but I guess you don't beat the shit out of the people you love. Or well, I don't know, maybe you do, I suppose. I don't know at this point.

Never had many friends, but who can you call a friend, honestly? Talked to some people but they never had problems with hurting me. I guess I don't learn, I grew to treat everyone super well  but I suppose it's because I was afraid of people hurting me. They kept doing it so I must be bad at being good. Or I wasn't good enough. Was bullied since kindergarten, got my ribs broken in elementary. Brother was born some time around this. I grew a taste for videogames. I still like them. They're good.

We changed states. Father told me he ""hit the jackpot and got the big raise"" but in the inside I knew it was to stop dealing with my shit at school. I grew up to be kinda shy, I guess. Never talked to anyone just to meet them, so I just stood when I saw someone I kinda wanted to meet. Kept getting bullied, had one or two mates, that's it. They abandoned me weeks after elementary, though. 

On middle school social life was hard. Met a pretty girl, first day. Remember her, I suppose. She was nice. Everyone else kinda sucked. I started to like girls, so, of course, I got harassed for that. My sister started to beat me, too. Still have some scars, but that doesn't matter I guess. The pretty girl told me stuff was going to get better. Got worse. Girls I liked started mocking me about fucking guys and stuff. Yeah, this sounds really fucking lame. Sorry. People never invited me to parties, got kicked out of the ones I showed up to. 

Pretty girl started dating me. She said she was going through stuff too, she wanted to be with me through it. We were happy. She cheated on me. On a girl and a guy at the same time. Really shouldn't care about that I guess. Then she started mocking me because she fucked girls. Kinda got used to it I suppose.

Attempted suicide on prom night. Kinda attempted suicide on Christmas and New Years Eve, I walked out of that.

Now I sit alone at my apartment listening to some Tyler the Creator. The only person I've ever loved is probably having the time of her life on someone's bed. My only friend just kicked me out of a Warframe lobby because he was going to hunt Eidolons and I'm bad at that. Family hasn't talked to me for a year now. Sister is living the life, brother is getting all the cool things I didn't deserve I guess. My cat Haley died 2 months ago. 

And I got so much left to say but reading all of the above made me wince so I guess I'll shut up now. I'm sorry. I should have the strength to go through this. I'm sorry if I don't see tomorrow. I really wanted to, if I could look foward to anything.

260253,"I used to have tiny hopes and now I have noneFor so long I've been going down and falling deeper into my depression, but I kept hoping I would get better eventually, I tried so hard but I'm giving up because whatever I do it only gets worse.

I had a dog and she was the only thread keeping me alive because I knew she needed me and she was always there for me when I felt the worst but now she's gone and it's partly my fault because I knew she needed a surgery but I couldn't afford it and was too overwhelmed with everything that didn't know how to try to make a fundraiser or anything and she suffered for a week before dying in my arms I also have a feeling that the vet kinda ignored a lot of symptoms and I should have seen another one and I can't get this image of her last hours out of my head and I miss her so much, she was my child, my best friend, my therapist 

I dropped out of uni in march because my antidepressants made me feel like my iq is 10 and I cannot focus for more than two minutes. I had a very demanding major and I was close to finishing and just threw it all away

I have a job only because my dad found it for me and called the boss (his friend) if he could hire me. I couldn't even find a fucking job. I feel so guilty because recently I've been doing everything so slowly or going weeks unable to finish my tasks and I think the only reason he hasn't fired me yet is because of my dad. He has lowered my income though and I don't mind the slightest because I think it's just fair. I'm only an expense to him.

I moved in with my boyfriend two months ago because I was constantly fighting with my parents over me being lazy and laying in bed all day. But now my mom is guilt tripping me even more because I'm living with a man before marriage. It's awful because we both moved out to run away from the stress in our homes, not because we thought of it as some next step in a relationship or whatever. 

I was crying to my bf about my mum yesterday and later I overheard him talk to his friends online how he hates my parents and then they all laughed at them how pathetic they are etc. But I love them and they've done so much for me, of course I'm annoyed at a few things but still love them and now I feel bad that I even mentioned it to my bf because now he hates them and I feel guilty again because they don't deserve being talked about like this 

I'm also really scared because the rent turned out to be much higher than I expected and I don't earn much money and my bf just quit his job and I feel like everything is on my shoulders and it's so difficult for me to care for myself only, there's no way I could provide for us both, I'm so scared 

I want to adopt a new dog, or a cat, or both, because I feel like I need a pet so much in my life, animals are pretty much the only thing that brings me any kind of joy in life, but I'm so irresponsible, I'm afraid I won't afford them, I'm afraid I'll finally kill myself and they'll be alone or I'll just leave my bf alone with everything 

And then last week I went to see my doctor and it turned out I don't have insurance anymore since I'm not a student anymore and at work I have the type of contract that doesn't pay these taxes (I live in a country with public healthcare). So I have to ask my boss to change the contract and it simply means keeping me will cost him even more and I feel guilty again and I can't bring myself to talk to him about it

So now I'm even scared to try to do anything because if I fail idk what will happen, will I have to pay some extreme price for the hospital or what, i don't know 

I just feel so guilty all the time and I hate myself and my meds are making it even worse because I can't focus or make myself do anything more than the basic minimum but without them I feel even more suicidal so I just keep existing and I'm scared of all ways of suicide but I also have no hopes for the future, I feel so lonely and as if there is nobody I could really honestly talk to

(16f) I fear everything. My boyfriend gets upset when he cant touch me at all. Due to ptsd. Every noise makes me tremble. And i always think that something bad will happen. I feel like ive been through so much i can just turn my numb button on. How i am now affects all my relationships with people.

I always seen girls on the tv and thought it was 1 in a million and could never happen to me. Until it did. And when it did i became aware of how big it actually is and how often it happens. After i had managed to escape last may, i was in impatient hospital care for 2 months to help with the ptsd but i dont feel as anything worked. My parents didnt know how to react so they werent as close then. I dont blame them because i feel like no one is going to know exactly how to react in a situation like mine. I dont feel like i could ever be in a relationship because the guys I've been with after couldnt understand or even try to understand when id jump or flinch or tremble when theyd even touch my arm or anything.

My mind races in public, online, when I'm alone. I find out how people act, and all the ways I can appease them and try to get on their good side to feel like I'm needed, I'm naturally kind to others. But at the same time, I'm always on my toes. Constantly guarding myself against others just incase if I were to say, be mugged, kidnapped, attacked, etc. I don't trust anyone. I'm always thinking about how I'm wrong compared to other's opinions, such as politically, morally, etc. Its so difficult to think anymore. How im self conscious about my stomach, the way I walk, how close I am to others in order to not draw attention or worry, not seeing or hearing well, forgetting a shit ton of things.

I can barely think.

And not only that, but this fucking burden of a blackened hole in my heart and my mind doesn't make it better. I want to never hurt anyone, I want to be alone forever.

I’m 18/m and I’m a senior in highschool. I had a pretty rough break up with a girl about nine months ago. I’m the one who broke up with her. I realize that staying with her would cause a world of problems years down the road. Her family is psychotic and her brother and I do not get along. That’s beside the point that’s not why I am posting this.

I honestly think I have been going crazy lately. She told me over the summer that her new boyfriend was so much better than me and that I did nothing for her. I’ve been grappling with this ever since she said it to me. People always say that words can’t hurt you but I think after she said that I was in the most pain I’ve ever felt. 

I feel worthless. I’m 5’4 and I’m 18 so the odds of me finding another girl are pretty slim. After I graduate I plan to go to college and I like to meet another girl but I’m worried my height is going to become a serious problem. I’m so stressed out about this I can’t even breathe. There are some nights where I wake up and have chest pains and shortness of breath. It scares me to think that I’ll never meet someone who will actually care about me and not pretend to like the last one. She met the new kid a week after we broke up and often talked about him while we dated. 

I don’t want to end up like all the early 20s people on 4chan complaining about their lives and how they can’t get a woman. I don’t know if I’ve ever really considered suicide but I am worried that if I keep thinking like this it may end up that way down the road.

73416,"The night that changed my life forever. (TW: Assault)I had a single mother growing up, alcoholic, etc. My father never wanted me and had actually said these words to my mother before my birth ""maybe if he finds the cure for cancer I'll have something todo with him"" so as you can tell. Very down to earth guy. Mother, damaged from all sorts of horrific things she had been through before my time. I've always had trouble connecting with people because of what I figure is how fucked up my interactions with my mother were throughout my life. I've thought of tapping out one way or another multiple times. More often these days. Especially with how afraid I am of meeting new people. But let's just cut to the long and drawn out chase. I was drugged and assaulted when I was 17. By the only two people that at the time I had thought were my friends. To this day I look in the mirror. See the marks on me, think of their hands on me. Hate the lack of defense I put up in that moment of weakness. And just get upset. I'm 23 now. Unemployed. Malnourished. Virtually zero friends. Body failing me. You know when you take a deep breath and exhale and get that feeling of ""yes, I am whole."" I haven't had that in far too long. Let me explain.
So it's an average night in the life of 17 year old me, I want to smoke weed. Not think about anything(Or think about everything). I go over to my friends place, I walk through his front door and he stops me for a second and says ""Hey man just wait here I gotta go talk to blah"" so he goes into the basement and does just that, me being me, thinks nothing of it. Then he comes back up the stairs and says ""alright let's go down"" we walk down and there is already a chair ready for me, bubbler in place, bowl prepared and made (there wasn't even any other weed around or a grinder in sight, just this bubbler and the green bowl inside it). And I once again, think nothing of it. I take the bubbler, smoke the bowl. It pops/crackles a few times, oddly. But you think nothing of it (cause you're with friends). Then you exhale, look across the room to your two friends and say ""so guys, what's up?"" and without either of them speaking. They both look at one another, get up out of their chairs simultaneously. Walk over to me. And the larger one of the two of them grabs my nose, and just starts twisting it to one side. I'm hearing cracks. I'm seeing his face strain from the amount of pressure he's putting on my body. But don't feel much of anything. Just hear stuff. Once he's finished with the nose. And I sort of half process what the fuck just happened. I just feel my consciousness get smaller. If that makes sense. Like I was still there, I could still see and ""feel"" but it was like there was this filter over my lens, like I was hiding within my own eyes watching this happen, it wasn't me at the time. But some poor sap who I was horrified for... I hadn't known then, but this was going to be a night I remembered for the rest of my life. At least what I could recall of it.
So we continue, after this point things do get a little out of order because I don't know if he grabbed this limb before that or did this thing before this. But what I can assure you of is that the nose happened first. So he just goes from one thing to the next, at one point he's got both my hands between his and he's grinding and clenching, more cracks are happening. Fun times are being had by all parties involved...ha. He put a thumb in each of my eyes and put pressure on them until I guess he saw what he wanted to see. All I can really get from that moment is just opening my left eye for a second (it felt worse than the right) and seeing red for a split second then just closing up my eye and trying to blink a bunch. One of my eyes has permanently blurred vision due to it. I get double vision frequently and have to focus to keep things centered(also I can sometimes see these floaties when I pay attention to them). He choked me, that really wasn't a big deal. Did this like vice-grip bear hug that had me hearing cracks throughout my torso. Put stuff in my mouth, down my throat, something in my eye. That was one of the more messed up things because I don't know what he put in my eye/area around it. All I do know is I remember our mutual friend at the time saying ""It's staying! It's staying!"" and to this day I still feel like somethings there but an eye doctor I saw said it's fine so it must be.. Anyway. He took my pants off. OH and I know I'm saying a lot of HE and not a lot of THEY because this really was more of a ""you stand there as a second entity so he will not try anything"" or at least that's what it seemed, which was silly because they are both 2 years older than me and I am smaller than both of them. He did have his friend grab one of my legs as he was putting pressure on my kneecap and sort of directed the other to mimic his actions on the opposite leg. Which he did. But anyway. Laundry list. Get through that. Popped my left ear drum with something. Pushed something metal into my upper left forehead area until it left an indent. Made my front straight teeth no longer straight with like a chisel thing (that goes along with ruining my smile and making me no longer want to smile anymore which ruins all future interactions I have with people because they think I'm just some asshole who thinks nothing is actually funny when I just don't want you looking at my fucking teeth.) So it goes on and on. Punched this hard as fuck. Punched that hard as fuck. Twisted this super hard until it stayed, twisted that. Pushed shoulder blades backward until they made some noise. So on and so forth. It got to a point where I was just smiling constantly. I guess because I was traumatized and didn't know what else todo. And he took these garden shears and got me to open my mouth, grabbed my tongue and put my tongue between them. But didn't do anything. ""Why do you care to mention this then total stranger"" Because it's one of the things I'm still trying to wrap my head around. For a majority of this night I didn't even look at him when he'd do something. He'd just do it and I'd have like a few seconds to sort of deal with what the fuck just happened before he'd move onto the next thing. But this time when he had the shears and obviously the next moment would be me missing half of my tongue. I just took that opportunity to look at him. I didn't say anything. Just looked in his eyes. And he stopped.. I don't know why, mercy maybe? But anyway. One mistake I made while this was going on was trying to ""re-center myself"" and I shouldn't even say try because I was succeeding even in that fucking situation I was finding a way to get through it. But what happened was there was a point where he like had me stand up. Stood me up. It was right after the leg shit. And wanted me to walk. So he sort of pushed me. and I just start walking. I guess he wanted to see how my body would move after the initial leg stuff. But anyway, I walked to the end of the basement past the stairs on the right side that I can still see in my peripheral. I wonder what would have happened had I tried something. So I hit concrete wall and I wasn't exactly thinking clearly so I just sort of pet it.. like stroked the wall. Maybe looking for a hidden portal that was going to make me wake up and tell me this is all just some fucked up nightmare. Unfortunately no. At some point I hear a noise as I'm stroking the wall, so I turn. And I see the larger one and he just looks at me. And I just look at him. I think there's a point where I'm walking toward him. Just looking at him. Slowly walking. And he just kind of grabs my jaw/head and quick twists it to one side. Like in a movie where a dude gets killed by some kung fu master and you're like ""hows that old man have such force? Must be excellent technique"" it isn't. From my experience it's just grabbing someone's jaw and head and throwing it in one direction. But maybe his technique was off zing?. So he did that, I fall to the ground (right side of jaw always clicks when I chew or open mouth too wide now), prop myself up on my palms and start crawling to him. (maybe subconsciously I was trying to make this as fucked up for him as he was making it for me) I'm not too sure what happened once I get to him. Ah yeah. He sat me in the chair again. And put me in front of the TV that was down there that we'd normally watch funny cartoons on or whatever else would be cool to watch while high. He had something playing on it. Maybe it was just TV but I don't think so. I honestly have no idea because I never tried to even look at it. Like you know when you look at someone and you just know nobody is home? That was me looking at the TV. So eventually he goes away for a few minutes, comes back with what I can only imagine was a hairdryer I didn't look, I just listened. Puts it on the back of my head. I can feel the heat. I start slowly inching my body forward. To avoid the heat. He keeps following me with it. Until the hair dryer stops working because I'm assuming here the cord wasn't long enough. And I fall forward. He picks me up after pulling the chair closer to the wall. Rinse repeat but this time he holds my head in place with his free hand. I wake up in a little room I was renting at the time in a house across town. I didn't go to the police. I never documented what I should have. I told my mom but she either didn't give a fuck or was too horrified to show it. She still has yet to show it though so I get the feeling she just neglected it like everything else.
Fast forward to present day. I weigh maybe 135lb, 5ft11, constantly starving myself (various reasons) and have tons of lingering medical concerns, the people that are still in my life keep pressuring me to get a job out of love. But I don't feel physically capable (forget about my social skills because those haven't gotten much better). And I have essentially no fucking experience. A good typing WPM though... 90+ if I focus. I spend 99% of my time failing to avoid thinking about everything I'm talking about here. I'm one of those people that thinks back to mundane shit he did when he was like 8 years old that literally everyone else has forgotten about and I still beat myself up over it, so you can imagine having something like this bouncing around my head ain't easy.. but anyway, what else? I can't properly urinate. Everytime I take a piss now I have to use tissue paper to wipe myself up and even then I go straight to the room, take a seat, and suddenly my underwear has a few splotches of grade A piss. Thanks old friend. Imagine this, having someone else force your body to struggle. And then being reminded by your body of what happened to you EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY! Whether you want to or not. Your body will remind you. My body reminds me. I wake up take a half-breath, thanks old friend. I stand up and hear multiple cracks. Thanks old friend.
These two guys are still out living life, I have actually been messaged by the best friend of the main guy that did it over Facebook. Not for any just reason either, just to send passive aggressive shit. But for years I didn't even want to believe that could have happened to me. Like most young teen males I thought I was fucking invincible man! How could that happen? Impossible. And so on. I forgot to mention he elbowed me straight down into my neck. I guess in an attempt to paralyze me? My immediate reaction when he did that was to try and lift my neck with my head. If that makes sense. It didn't work. I still at the end of it didn't get back to the same position I felt I was in before the elbow. Which also sucks (Ever since my neck cracks a heck of alot more than the never ever before this). That's what I was always trying to do after everything. To him it must've seemed like taunting, I wasn't trying to, but I guess thinking back it might have looked like me not audibly but physically saying ""yeah, and?"" these sorts of thoughts really fuck with me. Without getting into my upbringing drama and whatnot I'll just say that I always thought I could fix whatever I wanted to within myself. I haven't grown since the incident. Whether that's from me no longer caring about myself anymore and not eating or a mixture of the things he did to me and the lack of food, exercise, and general things humans do when they have a life they continue to want to live. I realized I lost track of my re-centering it portion of this. So eventually it got to a point where I was sitting in the chair and I was frozen but calm. And he didn't like that I guess. That I was finding my calm/center even in the middle of all this. So after I had calmed down he did another one of those fancy neck spin death kill moves. And I couldn't re-center after it. I just kept rocking. At first it was larger rocking but I did get it down to fairly minute rocking. But I think the rocking still might be happening. And that maybe that's a part of why I can't center myself. After that happened I dropped out of high school. Things didn't get much better from there. You can probably tell I dropped out just by how awful my structure and grammar must be.
Would you like to know what I believe is the reason why this happened in the first place? Two weeks prior to him inviting me over to his place that night. We had an argument at a Burger King, not even an argument. I had yelled at him while inside a Burger King. Over nothing. Literally nothing. I said some joke that must've not gone over well because our other friend who was with us started chastising me for messing it up or something. Then the assaulter said ""Don't bother the poor kid."" and I took it as ""Don't bother the Poor kid."" which didn't go over well with me because yes. I come from nothing. He comes from two parents who love him and gave him everything. So yeah in that moment it pissed me off. What was the worst thing I said? ""You're just a spoiled rich kid who gets everything he wants!"" did I deserve to have my life turned upside-fucking-down over those words? I don't think so. But then again it could've been something else. That day I remember him not even looking at me after I had said that. He left right after. I didn't think much of it cause I was used to a life of far worse exchanges with my mother. So when the two weeks had passed and we said nothing then he messages me I figured everything was fine.
I hope you enjoyed the read.

it’s pretty much been getting progressively worse since my girlfriend of three years told me that she just doesn’t love me or feel anything for me at all and completely cut me out of her life. 

people tell me that everyone has had breakups and that i’ll feel better and there are other girls out there but it’s clear that they’ve never felt like this. there’s a whole lot of other things in my life that makes me feel like everything is pointless but i could forget about all that stuff when i was with my girlfriend. honestly i hate how stupid it would sound to kill myself over a girl. 

my dad told me it would be so selfish for me to hurt myself but that really just made me feel like it’s my fault for wanting to just disappear. 

honestly it’s not the girlfriend part that hurts me. i can and have met other girls in the last few months. what really hurts me is that she was my number one best friend ever and was the only person who could help me through times like this. so now that she doesn’t feel anything for me and doesn’t care about me anymore, i have no one.

my friends are tired of me being sad all the time and i’ve reached out to so many people but they kind of dismiss things after telling me some canned bs about other fish in the sea. and then they’ll stop replying because no one really gets what’s going on in my head

i cant even put into words the emotions im feeling about being so alone and surrounded by people. every day i wake up in pain. such immense pain especially when i have dreams where i feel normal. i wish i had never been born to disappoint my friends and drive the one person who truly cared about me to give up on me. im struggling to find any way to make this pain go away. 

i look to the future and every possible scenario, even the ones that people tell me in attempts to cheer me up, give me no hope at all. why continue living if the pain won’t disappear even in the ideal life? nothing will change and nothing has changed. it’s actually gotten worse. i didn’t think that there was worse but there always is. i wonder when the pain inside will outweigh the guilt id feel about hurting my mom when i kill myself.

(English is not my native language and sry for that)

so where I live schools have opened today, and you can already walk in but only if you wear a facemask.

the problem is that my mom is an anti-vaxxer plus anti-mask supporter (2 in 1 haha xD)

so today I asked 

\-""where are my stuff so I can go to school?""

and her response was

\-""you aren't going to school with a facemask""

after that sentence, I really tried to change her mind like wow 

we've got in a super-serious fight 

I've never heard such great myths about masks

she is always seeking philosophical thoughts in anything 

(let me give you some context )

I'm the type of guy who is always trying to study everything in super great and fine details

I never struggled in any subject (except history and literature (2hard 4me xD))

if I don't understand something in... hmm let's say biology, I dedicate all of my free time until I'm brain dead (like 7-5hrs)(and my parents permit me to study anything until midnight). and I can get mentally upset easily :D. the pandemic wasn't hard id say it was easy for me, nothing changed in my lifestyle, but it changed how my mom behaved... she would always make me drink some unknown substances known by chemists, and if id refuse to drink she would try to talk that all I know abt viruses and biology overall is just a BIG B.S. and I should spend my time on better things like reading old books or being social to at least someone(about being social hits always me the most)

She's a good person I'm not trying to talk bad about her but I REALLY need to vent my brain here

I can't explain what I'm going through

I might have to change school coz of '' ay they insist to wear only face shields'' ""don't they know that masks block oxygen?"" 

the people who I know there is everyone I know 

that's the place where I met people and became who am I now

that's the place I spent my 10 years 

if id feel bad for something my native language teacher would try to have some time with me and have a talk about myself (how am I, what am I doing in life ...etc)

we have no bullies in school, everyone always tried to help each other

it will feel like tearing a piece from who am I now

I'm scared. I'm scared about the future. Will I be successful? Will there even be a future? What if I fail? I'm scared about the present too. I feel like I'm in a failing relationship only for the sake of convenience. the relationship feels comfortable. I love him but it feels like that sensation I once felt around him is slipping through my fingers. Is all love like this? Does all love die? Am I the problem? What am I doing wrong? There's so much I'm doing wrong. Theres so much I have done wrong. I tried to help a friend but I made stuff worse. I made it so much more fucking worse for both of us. I wish I could somehow go back and change that moment. I fucked it up so badly. I didn't help. It happened almost a year ago and to this day I still don't know if I did the right thing. She was so afraid. I think I made it worse. I make stuff worse sometimes. I try not to but I can be a bad person. I don't know how to come to terms with the fact that I can be a bad person. I don't want to be a bad person. No one wants to be a bad person. There have been so many bad people. I almost ended my life because of someone. She denies that she did anything to me. She's lying. She always lies. Shes out of my life for now. She clings to people I know like a virus. She is a virus. Some people can be viruses. I have a virus. I rely on him too much. I leave him but I crawl back when I do. I can't leave him. I was destroyed whenever I did the last time. I can't do it again but it is in3vitabely going to happen. He will leave me and I will struggle again. I don't know how I'm going to cope with that. Last time it was so bad. I couldn't fucking handle it. I don't know if I will be able to handle it. I'm still the same person I was when that first happened. I feel like I've changed but I'm not sure. What if I'm lying to myself? I probably am. This change feels fake. I thought I had made my mental health so much better but some days I just feel so bad. Some days I can't help it. Some days I break down and cry for the shortest reasons and I'm not sure if that's ok. Part of me thinks that it's ok. Everyone cries sometimes. Does crying make me weak? I'm not sure. I don't think so. I feel weak when I cry. I feel damaged when I cry. Crying is such a helpful feeling sometimes and such a destructive feeling at other times. Crying can release so much pain but it can also enhance it. Crying can stress you out. I know someone who can't cry. She hasn't cried for the last few years. At first glance that seems like such a blessing but she has no release for all her emotions. It builds up for her and then she takes it out in harmful ways. She hurts herself by not crying. I don't understand why she can't cry. I don't get it. She hurts so bad. I feel so bad for her. I want to help her so much but I don't feel like there's anything I can do. When people hurt sometimes there's nothing you can do to help but I don't like that. I want to help them but I can't. Most of the time I can help people. When I can't help people I feel bad. Apparently I'm good at helping people. I admire that trait. When I can't help people a part of me feels useless. Like I've failed at one of the few things I'm good at. It's odd. Life is odd. Being a teenager is so odd. It's filled with so much emotion and so many strange things. Sometimes you need to vent mindlessly which is what I've done here. I don't know if anyone will see it but that's ok. It's good to get stuff out sometimes even if it's just into the void. It's odd.",non-depression

I turned it back on Nov 25. I've been suffering from depression since I was born, and it has slowly drained my energy. I was diagnosed with Aspergers and knew it for year beforehhand, but I don't think I ever learned how to deal with people properly. I'm a self-harming masochist that gets driven wild from bleeding myself. I have no friends as I alienate them with my needs for help and I've gradually learned that no one -really- wants to help a dysfunctional mess like me. Back in 2017, my partner of 11 years (is it weird that I've had a full lover for half my short life?) agreed to marry me after years of pestering since I was shitty teen, but I honestly don't feel anything anymore. Just that leaving this life behind would hurt him so so much, but might be ultimately best. I've been a drinker for as long as I can remember, since 2nd grade when I learned most of my classmates didn't understand that I was ""sad"" all the time.

I've been rethinking of ending it all. I get tired of life's ups and downs. While a millennial, I feel like I wasn't properly prepared for constant disappointment. That no one told me about depression, anxiety, anger, alcohol abuse, and the pain of this. No one told me how to deal with mental health issues my whole life and that I'm not able to be regular. That I need medication to finally not feel like a waste. That being in this group has gsneralised me to being ""the reason America has gotten weak,"" despite being from a small farm about 10 miles from Edenbridge.

I've downed 10(?) full shots of 95% Everclear and I just don't know what's the point anymore. My parents are sleep, and I could just drink until I end. I could take a bath with my toaster, borrow and eat someone's gun, cut some inches deeper, anything. I don't want to do this anymore.

147343,"The dark placeHey there,

I was thinking about writing here for quite some time, but right now I just need some anonymous place for my thoughts. F 24yo, studying at university and struggling a lot with everything concerning this and the rest of life -- my nonexisting social life...
Last Tuesday, I tried to commit suicide. Had planned it quite some time ahead, even though I was a regular at my psychiatrist and my therapist. They knew about my depressing phase right now, but at one point I just couldn't get the feeling of ""it might be alright at some point, even if I can't see how"" anymore and I just tried to skip talking about this.
I wrote some mails to say goodbye to some people, finished some stuff I had to do so I would not leave and let some guys down that still required some tasks only I could finish due to responsibilities...
Well, I'm not even really sure, why I decided to write these mails, since in the end, they called the police, they found me unconscious at home and ambulance came... Well. I woke up at ICU and now I'm stuck in psychiatry...
I don't even know any more, how to feel about all that :/ I'm quite pissed that it failed. Suddenly, people care, suddenly, hypocritical, they speak up in my life, they are shocked... whatever. Nobody cares all the time. Now it's me, being in a dark place with no right to say that I don't wanna live anymore. Even the professionals here just say their positive stuff like ""I'm sure there will be some day and it will be fine"" and ""there is always a way""... But of course, nobody can say, how I should face the problems in reality. Nobody says how I should continue with failing big at university. My circle of friends is around 0, just sitting around at home, browsing reddit or whatever -- trying to face my exams, my anxiety kicks in and I don't sleep anymore, quivering all day, sweating... 
I don't know what to do. They keep me alive here, yeah. Wont try anything in here, cause it wouldn't work anyway. But I really can't see how hanging around here, maybe even trying some therapy at the clinic for some time should change something. It's not like a ""hey, do something else in your life"" will fall from the sky with a solution, i can't take a break from studying because I would lose financial support. 
I'm not really good trying to stay in contact with people I meet, diagnosed personality disorder extremely helpful to socialize with people... 
So I'll just stay here, since I'm not allowed to leave, obviously. But man, I'm not even motivated to stand up. What's the point in trying to get better, in trying anything to get up when I'll fail again and again... 
Well, thank you, whoever read until here, I just had to get it off my chest somehow... It's so dark here and I don't see a path out.

For 10 months we were ""together"" trying to figure out how for her to leave her bad marriage. She told me all the time how horrible her husband is and how she wanted to live life with me. She came clean about a month ago to her husband, telling him about me. He guilted her into staying. Saying she disobeyed God and him and now she owes it to him to stay. Well she continued to tell me she believes God will let her leave someday. I found out tonight her husband told her to leave. Literally got a suitcase and put it in front of her, only for her to decide to stay. She has also gone back to sleeping with him. But in the emails she was telling me these things she was also saying how she continues to pray everyday for God to bring us together. I don't know what to do. Her husband threatened to put a restraining order on me. I feel so guilty and also at the same time so hurt by the constant back and forth ""I believe we will be together, I need to stay.""

My life sucks right now, and it probably will for a long time. To other people I'm always loud and smiling and laughing but inside I feel like I'm living a lie. My parents, well they are not good people. Not abusive, but my mom is a bipolar bitch and my dad is a lazy douchebag. My stepdad is just an asshole. My friends, most of them are pretty fake to me. None of them really know me and I have no intention of opening up. I feel pretty unmotivated about doing anything, schoolwork seems more like a waste of time than anything else these days. The only thing that truly keeps me from ending it all, when things get really bad and I'm laying in bed in a huge bout of depression (it is on and off, sometimes it gets to me hard) is willpower/insanity? There's always a voice in my head scolding me about being weak and selfish. How dare I allow the cruel thing that is life to defeat me? Am I so selfish as to not even consider the effect it would have an the people around me, even if I don't like them? It brings me right out of it for a while. But lately it seems like that voice is getting weaker and weaker, while dark thoughts are getting more and more desirable.

I will write a note detailing what to do in the event of me ""surviving"" and entering a coma (you can guess what I would want them to do). I have a journal in which I will write my final words and thoughts. I will leave a message in that journal for everyone I love and care about, and my parents. I have a lot of writing to do between now and tomorrow because I want this to be done well, I really care about these people. I will also probably make one last post on this subreddit, thanking everyone who tried to help me. 

I am still hesitant though, my mood swings so much I dont know what is real. It's difficult because I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mood disorder so I dont think I am getting the proper support. What I do know is, I hate who I am and I know that I will never be the person I want to be. I am so unhappy and anxious. Sometimes I'm euphoric but those moments are short and fake. Everything I do reminds me how much I hate myself, even seeing my hands or hearing my voice. Sometimes I like the way my voice sounds, and sometimes I also find myself very attractive and I feel happy during those times, but I know those feelings are unrealistic. I see myself die everytime I close my eyes.

My dad used to abuse the shit out of me. Mom even had an evidence photo album of me covered in hand shaped bruises or with scars that I still have today.  He's changed now, but the damage is done. Not like I can go to him for help or anything anyways because he always just tells me I haven't lived life yet. I can understand why he says that though. Ever since I was in high school I have been a recluse. Many of my family members died when I was a kid. Then growing up I had friends die too. I've seen a dead body up close on multiple occasions. As a kid my only real friend was the internet. But even that is shitty now. YouTube sucks and is corporate with a shitty team running it. Team fortress 2 is full of robots running automatic cheats. All my old forum friends haven't been online in years. My last tail of happiness was in 2016, living with my grandmother, basically doing whatever I wanted. But then a family member of ours died and she moved to a different state. So I have since then just been in the dark in my room in my dad's house. It's understandable why he wants me to gtfo so much. I don't provide anything and use his electricity all day without pay by scrolling endlessly online. I've worked before, and I fucking hated it.

But then I start to wonder what happens after death. Where will I go? Will I cease to be? And my brain can't process it, almost like it won't let me. I'm scared. But I am also constantly suffering.

I got constantly bullied for being overweight and different. I attempted suicide in Grade 8 but failed. I then went to a different high school thinking things would get better and they did for a bit. I am now in my senior year of high school and this is supposed to be the most important time of your life.

Overall I feel like I've been given up on. I think that over the course of the relationship that I've been given unreasonable expectations. Probably because  for the longest time, I would do everything I could, give it all I had to make it work. It might of just become an expectation now that I would always go to the enth degree to make it work. Like any person I've made many mistakes before, some big some small, always working through it, but it's different now. Now I think that no matter what I try, not matter what I do it wouldn't change anything and that makes me sick to my stomach.

I have been rejected by pretty much everyone in my life and the few people I had left (my parents) have seemed to shut me out too. I guess they’re just tired of me, and I don’t blame them really I am a lot to deal with. 

There have been many things recently which have really given me perspective on how I’m just not good enough for anyone. Since escaping a DV relationship last year I’ve tried dating a few times. I even found a regular FWB  who I’ve grown to quite like (it wasn’t just sex, we had started hanging out and flirting on a regular basis). When I brought up is this going anywhere he said “look, I really like hanging out with you but you’re a bit bigger than the girls I’d normally date”. And to be honest that crushed me, If he’d just said no, that would have still hurt but the fact he had to point out my looks really cut me deep. 

I fight the urge to self harm pretty much every night, and cry myself to sleep each night because i just wish that I wouldn’t wake up. 

I’ve tried the suicide hotlines but really I feel like they’re so condescending and are really no help at all. 

I’m not sure if this makes much sense, I’m quite upset right now and just essentially spewing word vomit onto reddit.",depression

As if I care at all about the degree I'm studying for, as if I have any motivation to keep working, as if society isn't going to collapse in 20 years anyway.

I mean, I know things don't get any better than this. Maybe I get a job that pays a little better than the shit service job I have now, maybe I pay off my student loans, but fundamentally I'm going to be stuck in the same rut I am now. So why am I still going to work instead of getting drunk and driving my car into a wall? I guess I just haven't worked up the nerves yet. But I will, sooner or later.",depression

3. [This](https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1237181844275240971)
4. Harry broke bro code and took MJ for himself
5. Norman Osborne loves Peter more than his own son to the point where he says he was surprised Harry graduated, and then talked to Peter about a science award and how very smart he was
6. Peter was kind of a creep. He kept following MJ legit everywhere
7. MJ didn't recognize that Mr. Spidey and Peter Parker weren't the same guy based on his voice, but potentially from a kiss or whatever I haven't watched the second one yet.

243928,"What's happening to me. All of sudden I realize I don't want to live. The many things I've tried to sweep under the rug are staring me in the face.I'm in my mid-twenties, male, short stature. I feel so sick lately. I admit I haven't had a good amount of sleep due to nightshift hours, but my negative thinking (which is not so usual for me) have been immense. 

I recently quit weed and alcohol after years of abusing it, mostly in isolation. During this time my ex gf made many attempts to reconnect with me and even more so recently. We hung out a bit, then I let it go. I just sat in kind of wait for what would happen, knowing I was too scared to make a move. Mainly because she took a very healthy turn in her life in the years we had apart and I really didn't. She just got a new bf and though I want her to be happy with a good person, I came to realise she was one of the best people in my life, more caring than anyone else I've know. My short stature does make it harder to simply find an S/O, confidence was my game with women but I've lost it. Re-built it many times, but now I have no energy left.

I'm eating healthy, going to the gym, working, just not coping at all. Sleep is difficult, I stay awake because I'm scared to close my eyes and have suicidal thoughts. I'm strongly considering smoking weed again an accepting my fate as a low-life because I don't have much going for me.

I feel like I tick many boxes of a person who commits suicide.

* Mental issues
* Unsteady employment (have not kept a job for longer than 9 months)
* Un qualified in any field
* Relationship problems
* Was emotionally abused growing up
* Drug/alcohol abuser
* Isolation
* The big 5: neuroticism, agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness describe me perfectly


All these things stacked against me confirms that this is not just a small feeling that will pass. It's the beginning of something. I feel like I am in very deep. I have feel-good moments in the day, but I want to end my life because the suicidal thoughts/ideas are unbearable. 

I want to see my gp. Last time I was prescribed anti-depressants they made me feel much worse.

As I said I want to just smoke weed again. I've smoked weed since 16 and it has got me through all this shit. It did make some things worse - losing lisence, expelled from school, losing gf, family fights. I just can't win. Smoking weed with someone helps, on my own not so much.

I don't want to leave my brother. He struggles with depression too. He's an awesome guy and has done everything right. I can't bare to cause immense pain to my family, especially not him. It's the last thing he deserves. He's what's holding me back from this. But the immense pain and lack of solution is making me crazy.. I just want to feel good about myself and life again. I want to have ambitions and confidence again. To speak clearly and be assertive again. I feel like I've slipped away completely and will only ever ""cope"" with my new-found reality. I was deluded before, now I see the picture properly and it's too hard to look at. 

I have many regrets. People say look to the future and not the past, but in my past I was so misguided and my actions have directly hindered my ability to have an organised, easy-going life. 
I'm scared and I don't know what else to do. I can keep going for now. I'm just scared if this keeps up I will not be able to go on, especially come birthday time etc. I lost many friends, I emotionally my hurt family, I can't bare this shame and regret.",depression

248494,"Why doesn't anyone like me?In the past month I've lost all of my friends. A year ago I stopped cutting my wrists and arms because I had met a girl who agreed to be my girlfriend. She made me laugh all day, and we had so many good times together. She broke up with me a month ago with a single message, and refused to talk to me after that. She moved to another Country and white-listed her phone numbers so I couldn't talk to her. I never did anything to her, I just wasn't the one. That's when I started cutting again. I posted on here before but nobody commented after a month so I got embarrassed, cried, cut myself, and passed out in a small puddle of my blood. I tried to drown myself the day after, only to be pulled out of the river by my friends dad who was supposed to be dropping me off at a party. My friend found out and refuses to talk to me now, along with my other friend who noticed my scars and said he won't be there when put myself in a ditch somewhere. I told my ex-girlfriend who I still communicate with on a daily basis. She's uncomfortable talking to me now. I want to die more than ever now. I was raped as a 5 year old kid and now live with an embarrassingly overprotective and perfectionist family, which makes me want to die even more. Nothing I do is good enough for them, they try and forzce ADHD meds down my throat, call me a dumbass and a retard on a daily basis and remind me of how much of a waste of skin I am to start my morning. I lay in bed, depressed because I didn't die in my sleep from some chemical spill or disease. I have to go to a math class with a math teacher whose a fucking imbecile and doesn't know his shit, yet is allowed to teach a class of students, meanwhile I keep being reminded I don't meet the requirement to be an exceptional human being. If somebody would talk to me or something that'd be super cool of them.

135632,"Want it to be overHi, I'm 22 and this is me first time actually trying to post things like that or even let anyone know about it. My problem is that I'm a failure and a burden for my family and others. I am a very weak person, I always avoid conflicts or problems and don't really have a personality to get over it.  Don't honestly know why I'm posting this because it's just stupid, maybe just needed to share it with someone. So, I've been trying to end my life since around 11-12 years because I felt out of place all the time, but every time thoughts of my mom going through the consequences of that would stop me. Before I continue, a bit about my family: I have a very supportive family who paid for my education, helped me to move, never had any financial issues in life or anything like that. Currently, I have a good life with good opportunities, but it still doesn't change a thing for me. So, in order to keep it going I've been looking years for something to do in life. And I feel like I found it and have been dedicating myself 100% to it for months, but I just can't get any improvements or progress. I keep failing even tho I spend whole days(10+ hours a day for 3 consecutive months) trying to get better at it, and I love doing but failures just don't stop. I also have years of past experience of something very similar which helped not to be a complete failure And after 3 months I can't stand it anymore. I'd been trying many things before and failed at them too, but I thought it was due to lack of interest in them and me not trying hard enough. Guess I was wrong and the problem is me being totally worthless human waste. And on top of that, all that my family did for me makes me feel even worse because it's been basically wasted for nothing. So, I just don't want them to waste more on me, and I just want to end my pathetic life because I simply can't achieve anything or become a worthy human being.  The only thing that stops me is my mom. I just need a way to get over these thoughts, and finally end this. ",depression

Long story short, my parents were abusive, i am the youngest of three accidents. My mom was emotionally manipulative, my dad was physically, spiritually, emotionally. Like if you see the wikipedia for narcissistic parent, my dad is everything they list. My mom is alright due to her making up for her abuse by trying to be an actual parent throughout my life, she tries her best. My dad cheated on my mom, had a kid with the random lady and lost his job so oops.

I have never really been a social outcast, I make friends very easily and with that I had a way to avoid my home by being outside with others. Even with my escape, I still was miserable. I always feel like ""happiness is temporary, depression is eternal""

I tried killing myself almost a year ago. Literally like, a day from now will be the year anniversary. I've been working hard for a while, with a sidejob at one point, I'm a second year at an animation college, I try to balance everything with my social life. I just, cant handle it anymore. My constant depressing and suicidal thoughts are making me feel really empty inside and sometimes I get used to it, other times it makes me want to drag my nails through my fucking eyeballs.

I'm burning out of steam and I can't fucking take it anymore. I'm really tempted into going outside right now and jumping in front of a fucking car. i just cant.

Because as soon as I get the idea in my head to be happy, they attack. I just want to be happy. When was the last time I was happy? I could tell you a million times when I was happy, but all those times were fake because in my head I knew, I knew that it was fake. I couldn't even begin to explain how and why I'm so unhappy. It's always been there with me. Always in my chest pushing against my rib cage, hurting, not letting me forget my true feelings. It hurts from the time I wake up to the time I finally fall asleep at night. It's there when I'm smiling or screaming in pain for it to stop. It's my lover and protector. I don't think I could live without it. It's the only thing I feel, and if I let it go what would be left? I'd be an empty shell, a zombie if you may. I can't let it go. It keeps me alive.

I am amazed. It feels as if I'm on the moon, gazing at the stars, planets and nebulas. Ever since I lost my previous best friend of seven years in 2015, I've been lonely. I rarely had a reason to smile, and I got into a habit of just being blank. Every day I looked at other kids, read books with characters who have these amazing connections, and wished I could have that with someone. And now, I got it. Now I can experience that friendship, albeit online, and it's absolutely amazing. My cheeks hurt with the stretch of my grins, I stifle my laughter in class and I look back on conversations with a fondness.

It's *nice*, in that unbelievable and indescribable way, having a legit best friend. A person who you immediately feel comfortable with, who you know will support you no matter what, no strings attached. It's amazing having this person as your best friend.

136335,"I really hate every single part of my life. Guys I've been feeling this way a long time now. I really am just having a harder and harder time each day justifying why is life like this. Here's a brief synopsis of my story. 

Dad abandoned the family when I was 5, causing a lot of issues. My brother, who was the closest person in my life at the time, borrowed some money from me three years ago, the day I gave him the money was the last time I ever saw or spoke to him. I've heard from various people things he's fabricated about me, and I can't believe it. Mom always puts a ton of pressure on me, and I found out two years ago that when I turned 18 she took out credit cards in my name and maxed them out......

Because of all this family issues, I've done horrible in college, probably around a 2.0 gpa. I can barely even muster up enough money to eat every week. 2 weeks ago I lost my job, and the guy (it was a small firm with 4 employees) is actively fighting me getting unemployment. I spend most of my days trying to figure out how I can make this little money I have last until I get a paycheck from a job I don't have. Not to mention I'm graduating with more debt than I can possibly pay off. 

1 year ago I lost all my friends. Someone had stolen something from one of our friends, and I guess some people thought it was me, when confronted I offered to replace the item but said I didn't steal it. Everyone took that as an admission of guilt and I never heard from them again. 

Girls, I have no luck, I've only had 1 gf for 2 months. I am constantly rejected, most recently by a friend who I have grow really fond of. Now the thought of us not being together, or the though of now she will be with someone else just kills me. 

I just don't think life should be this hard. For years I've constantly asked myself what is wrong with me, I keep losing the few relationships I have. I feel alone there are days when I don't even speak a word cause there is no one to talk to, and my failures in other parts of my life are just making things worse. I've felt this way for so long, but now it just feels like I'm advancing to the next day each day just to get closer to death. 

When you count things I'm thankful for, there's honestly not much, I don't think a single part of my life is anything but terrible. I use to always hear ""things will be better"" but year after year they just keep getting worse.

243362,"My love for school and the wonderful feelings it fills my heart with (/s). When I'm outside of school I usually feel confident, sociable and in tune with myself, but walking through the hallways of my school makes me unusually self-conscious.

I am 18M, I really like my aparance and personality, I know I've got a rich and interesting ""inner world"" (for lack of a better term), I'm well adjusted despite my terrible childhood and I know from experience that I can be very charming if I put in some effort.

I'm confident.
I've even gone through a youth militarily program and didn't come out messed up at the other side.
But for some reason being in school just makes me slowly die inside.

I feel so damn self conscious inside those god forsaken walls. 
I know that teenagers are for the most part horrible judgemental people (kinda /s) but I've hung out with shitty people before and felt right in my element. I can hang out or party with strangers with no anxiety. I've approached girls that catch my fancy without feeling very nervous. 

But walking around school is somehow very trying for me.

It might stem from how stifling school feels in general. I'm pretty introspective and intelligent, and I grew up without much outside influence from my peers. I'm my own person and proud of it, but it can be incredibly hard to relate to the people around me in school.


Idk where I was going with this really, guess I'll end it with apologizing for my slightly bad English. Not my first or even second language, and I can't be bothered to fix my mistakes rn.

my mother psychologically/physically abused and severely neglected me as a child, father abandoned me, never had friends. still dont have friends.  mom still isnt great. claims to never have money. i own like 2 shirts,  a single pair of pants, 2 pairs of shoes (one of which is broken, so 1 wearable pair) and 2 pairs of socks. i dont even fucking have clothes. and the ones i have are oversized. 2-3 sizes too big. i look like a clown in them. i also have virtually no memories from ages 0-14. just some fragments, mostly abuse from mom.  


Dont have a job. i study in gymnasium. went to a psychiatrist a little while ago, got prescribed antidepressant. dont even have money to buy it. even though it should be like 7 euros? (doctor visits are covered, meds are not)


somehow, every time something good happened to me, life fucked over all of my friends. - something nice happened to me, something bad happened to them. something good happened to them? something bad happened to me. i have no idea why this is the case, and im not a superstitious person, but somehow theres a pattern. and apparently  i managed to convince myself through this that i dont deserve anything good. 


to top all of this off, i'm trans. utterly hate my face and genitals. and i have no money to change anything.
and nothign related is covered by my country's equivalent of NHS. nothing at all. and this depresses me. 
oh and as icing for this bit: the trans specific doctor i saw today called me a dude. how very professional of him. as i was taking myself back home on my bike, i saw all these ladies in the city, all of them pretty , a lot of them with significant others. i'll never have this :/ 


i honestly see no future for myself, let alone a future i want.
theres no light at the end of the tunnel for me, its a looping tunnel.

81321,"My StoryFor months I've been reading your stories from my cell phone at night once my wife and kid are in bed. I thought its finally time to tell my story (before i do something that will prohibit me from doing so in the future)

22 months ago I had emergency brain surgery, it was very sudden. Just started getting headaches at work one morning, asked my boss if i could leave early. 12 hours later i was rushed to hospital. Turns out i had massive build up of fluid on the brain due to a blockage and an operation was needed immediately. I was supposed to have been able to return to work a few days later, it was a relatively safe procedure. 

The operation is called an Endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Lasted a few hours. When i woke they immediately knew there were complications. I knew my wife but couldnt remember that we married(funny right?) So my short term memory had been affected. I literally had a 15 second memory(like in Finding Nemo). I would speak to someone, turn my head then not rememer the conversion at all. 
2 months in hospital my memory improved somewhat with the help of occupational therapy.
Only on the day i got discharged did i find out I had been put on antidepressants during my stay, now this caused a whole lot of shit in my life during the next few months but i was able to wean myself off it eventually(took months) 
Life at work has been rough. Im in I.T working for a top finanacial institution. 1-2 weeks out of the month i work 12 hour days. With my memory issues I can work a normal 9-5 but with my work those overtime requirements nail me. Oh forgot to mention the other fall out of my operation - Stamina levels. In hospital i needed rest every 90min(would sleep 3/4 the day. Obviously its improved now but when i get tired its not a normal tired. Imagine a ton of bricks on your shoulders weighing you down pulling you into the earth. Thats the kind of tiredness i experience to this day after a certain hour.
I started half day initially then back to full day after 2 weeks. Back then i would speak to my manager freely until one day I told him I was struggling, he cut me short right there and said if this continues we need to go spk to HR. Needless to say I havent spoken to him in months. 
Going to cut this short now. Getting tired.
On the home front. Looks like il be getting a divorce soon. Thinking of quitting my job, taking what little pension i've accumalated, put money away for my boy. Then offing myself in a few months.
Things have gotten progressively worse lately, no one to talk to anymore. The whole ordeal is destroying my mother.

340309,"Much Like Everyone Else HereGiven the frequent calls for help, writing anything here is a bit of a gamble.

I can *feel* that I'm losing the will to live, but I'm not there yet. I've made request after request, seen numerous therapists, taken numerous meds from numerous psychiatrists, and feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable. As if, somehow, a miracle will happen by crying out so often.

I know I need to earn my place in life. I'm just so tired. Literally tired. I've been emotionally tired for a while now, but in recent weeks I've had a hard time retaining any energy.

One or two weeks ago, I saw a homeless man pushing his broken cart down the street in front of my house. He was mumbling to himself with a dead look in his eyes. He was alone, but muttering to himself. Just seeing this stunned me. It was like several fears and thoughts were struggling to get in my head at once. Many of us, the hopeless, feel like that already. Wandering alone, feeling unsafe, feeling helpless, but pushing on because that's what we're told to do. That guy just happened to be even worse off.

Is that what we're doomed to be? Helpless shadows of our former selves, wandering anywhere because we're not wanted anywhere?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm letting fear get the best of me. This would be the place to do it though. Better to become rattled in writing, than to be rattled where it'd bother people that know me.

&amp;#x200B;

You're talking to yourself, at this point, Joe. But that's fine. A ""note"" to look back on, maybe. The chance to get my thoughts out, at least.

I repeat myself all the time on this site. Rarely on this subreddit, but I've dotted several others with pleas for help, or requests for suggestions. I don't even know how common my kind of cases show up. Am I just another drop in the ocean? People have responded to my entries before, but very rarely do I find what I'm looking for.

Jeez. What *am* I looking for? There's no ""cure"" for depression as of yet. Not the biological kind, anyway. I barely know much about dysthymia, polymorphism HTTLPR-5, and my other topics to avoid at dinner. I only know most of them are biological. My meds help. Sure. They don't make me feel ""good"", but they make me feel better. I've recently been having nightmares of scenarios that mimic those feelings I had, when things were worse.

I live in shame lately. Feeling unwanted, or rather, tolerated. I believe my brother and my mom love me, but sometimes I feel that I'm too much of a burden. At the same time, I know they'd reassure me with that empathetic, yet fiery, look in their eyes. Conviction. Almost upset with me for thinking otherwise. It's a weird comfort.

I feel like I almost don't exist outside these walls sometimes though. I have very few ""exceptional"" qualities. I'm not attractive, I'm unemployed, I'm emotionally unstable, my insides look like bags of fruit punch trying to squeeze through plastic nets, I struggle to ""feel alive"", and I'm terrible at maintaining contact with the friends I have.

I know its not healthy to dwell on my negative qualities, but I don't think I've ever had someone close to me *truly* believe in me. At least, not in a long time. I kinda squandered that in my stupid teenage years. Now I get treated like a kid announcing that he wants to be a dinosaur when he grows up, whenever I talk about what I want to do in my future.

If someone was reading this, they certainly stopped by now. Still, I might as well keep writing. I sound crazy even to myself, but at least this offers some stress relief.

I remember when I used to blame ""luck"", or something conspiring against me, for my misfortune. I know it's not true now though. My misfortunes are my own doing. The odds of me being a victim of circumstance for this long are very unlikely. Still, I think that it's possible for *someone* to be that unfortunate. I hope I'm wrong though. No one deserves to be *that* miserable.

Where was I going with this? Suicide? Yeah. I feel like I'm just running low on willpower. I'm sure lots of people are feeling weaker and sadder lately, given recent events. Once this is over though, they will be able to heal. Not me though. This crap is has been tattooed into my head since I was eleven.

I'm not trying to be ""bleak"". It's just how things have been for about two-thirds of my life. The odds of things changing now require that aforementioned ""miracle"".

I pray this will pass though. I'm not dead yet. I *want* to get better. As sad as it is to say, I know some people just want to be miserable. I was once like that too after all. *That* kind of thinking is crazy. But I understand feeling so weak that you just want the credits to finally roll. Sometimes it would just seem easier to sleep and never wake up. Dream of feeling valued, for the rest of eternity.

As nice as it would be for that to happen, I need to be realistic. I knew as soon as I started this drawn-out message that nothing would change. I welcome being wrong, but if so many professionals and nearly two decades of fighting can get me out of this, why would I expect someone to suddenly appear with my remedy? My cure?

What hurts is that this pain is not mine alone. I *know* there are others out there who have it far worse than me. My nightmares happen when I'm asleep, but at least I live in a loving home. Some people don't even have *that* luxury.

Write something later, Joe. You're clearly feeling particularly negative at this moment. Even if those thoughts go unanswered, at least you will have cemented some better thoughts to look back on.

It feels silly writing to *myself*, but there's a small comfort in it. Immediately followed by regret upon remembering my memory of the homeless guy muttering to himself.

Whatever. Hopefully things will be more manageable in the morning.",depression

Blood puddles spread through the cracks on the tiled floor. Glazed eyes gaze eternally at the mildewed shower wall and faded curtains. My security weakened, cold greets my feet. Over the obscure path I make my way to the light seeping through from under the door. I knock. “Are you alright?” I ask her. “Oh yes! I’ll be out soon!” Relief. My shoulders slide down into the usual position as I- stop. Stop. Stop. I feel as if my flesh must be torn. My head droops as I stare at the never ending void. “I must be free. Won’t you free me? Let the pain flow and screams burst? Free me. Stop. Free me. Stop. Stop. Stop.” Relief. My shoulders slink down and I make my back to bed. A bottle rolls across the floor after my weak foot pushed it. The vision of my partner and I dancing around the room resurfaced. The moon smiled down on us as lust thickened in the air. The bed creaks as I sit down. Outside the window, few cars can be seen daring the night roads as snow glides to cover the cold, dead grass. The city is mostly dead at this hour, except for the unfortunate souls slaving away to provide us with our needs and keep us from the burdens they face. Soft hands drag down along my spine. I can rest easy now that my dear wife has returned to bed- No. No. No. Blood trickles down and covers all. Sorrowful ribs stick out to greet the filthy mirror. Vomit meets the yellow sink. Oh how I long for the pain of my own torture! My own demise as sweet as midnight roses in a lonesome garden. Oh lord! Free me from my suffering! -
My wife sleeps as I am eaten by my own wolves: my thoughts, my pain, my own beloved destruction. My feet once again meet the floor, they carry me to the dark hallway where I dance with my shadow and kiss the steel of a passionate blade. Oh the relief you could give me, sweet sharpness! But oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! My torment must continue on. For my sweet darling must not suffer of my fate! I would be lucky dead so as to not see her riving from pain. The price I pay now is not greater than the one she would be burdened with. My love for her is enough to rip my being apart, yet my reasons to live can be counted on one finger. My dear! My love!

you know in American Psycho when Bateman breaks up with his date and says ""i have homicidal thoughts that cannot be corrected""? it's like that. this cannot fucking be fixed and i'm sick and god damn fucking tired of trying and doing the same bullshit every day, tired of holding a fucking knife to my neck to stop thinking of suicide, tired of fucking hating every worthless second.

i just fucking hate every waking moment of every day. the only thing i enjoy is sleep and i got 2 hours of that before work today. god it just fucking HURTS. i'm anxious all day every day about fucking everything. and i've been taking care of myself - i've been taking lexapro every day like i should, working out 6 days a week, eating right, getting re-enrolled, going to therapy. it's not fucking working and i feel even worse than i did during my first attempt. for the first time in 3-4 years i've actually tried, and i've been better and corrected behaviors, and i feel fucking worse than i did when i was smoking pot, skipping class and playing video games all day

i've been taking care of myself but nobody gives a fuck about me. the 3rd girl i've ever loved gave me the most intimate experience of my life, a week later professed her love for me at a party she came to with her boyfriend, and the next day told me over the phone she doesn't feel anything for me. this was last week. we knew eachother for 4 fucking years and this is how our beautiful adventure ends.

i've been talking to this girl for 2 months that i like sort of. we've been on dates and made out and she was my v-day kiss. we work nearby so i saw her for like 30 mins when her store was dead, i went and got breakfast for her and we make plans to go to her place tonight. now it's ""oh sorry me and my friend just made plans, oh and i forgot that other girl is staying the night"". i canceled going to a fucking concert with my brother and his best friend for her to do this again. if you don't like me, just tell me you don't fucking like me so i don't have to hate myself. you don't have to sugar coat it, you talk to me one way but treat me another, just fucking say it and i'll fuck off if that's what you want.

here, okay, this is the best one. my best friend. my best friend is a girl i've been close with for 5 years. that's a quarter of my life. i just got out of a 4+ year abusive relationship with my ex and i'm finally, after years of this happening and months of us being separated, telling my BEST FRIEND about the verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. her reaction? ""oh wow. Jaiden did that? Wow! I can totally see that."" fucking nothing! ""I... can't keep it to myself anymore. I was sexually abused for a really long time."" ""daaaamn Anon wow!"" 

we're talking about something deep yesterday and i finally reveal to her, after a year of it killing me inside and no one knowing, i attempted suicide. and she literally just fucking ignored it.

i'm a normal fucking guy and i've been taking care of myself. i was a recluse for so long and these past few months i've been saying fuck it, i'll fight through the anxiety and paranoia and i'll do it. i'll be healthy. i get a job, get things sorted out with school, i lose 10 pounds and regain a lot of lost muscle, play guitar and sing like i used to, and i just feel fucking worse. and i TRY to have these relationships and it just makes it worse.

i'm not an asshole, i'm not annoying or unfunny, i'm a normal, intelligent, attractive guy who gives a fuck about shit and takes care of himself. but no one cares about me. you know that song ""Behind Blue Eyes"" by The Who that Limp Bizkit shat all over? that's me.

i'd rather just go back to being alone, because at least i had control. i'd rather be an addict or an alcoholic. i'm fucking tired. i feel like shit every day and realize no one loves me or will ever love me. there's just something wrong deep down inside, and i just wasn't meant to be here.

this is the perfect time of year for this actually. that song ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra - the message and the chronology. he keeps trying and trying and if he never wins then it wasn't meant to be, ""if there's nothing shaking this here come July, I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die"".

i turn 21 July 1st. if things don't change by then... if they just get worse like they keep doing... i'm doing it this time, and i'm fucking doing it for real. no pills and alcohol. i'm going to make it work.

A year ago I had a suicide crisis which caused a temporary split and an inpatient stay at the local hospital's psych ward for me. We got back together and tried to make things better. I started going to therapy at the local county mental health center (sliding scale fee), seeing the psychiatrist there every few months for med adjustments and such, and have been diagnosed borderline personality disorder and severe recurrent major depression without psychotic features. I signed up for the list for the DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) group at the mental health center. In the meantime my boyfriend went to a clinic in northern Germany for his anxiety. We started having frequent arguments, usually my fault, though unintentionally. I don't like arguing and I never have and I've always felt horrible. He broke up with me a month ago but we tried to stay friends. I've tried to avoid arguments but we had another one this morning and I felt horrible about it but he's now decided we can't remain friends and wants me out of his life. He was the only friend I had at this point, everyone else bailed when I had my crisis a year ago. Now I don't know what to do. I'm devastated and afraid and still desperately in love with him and don't want things to end but I don't know what to do. I struggle with suicidal ideation in general, even with meds, but this is making it all worse. I both want to die and am terrified of dying at the same time. I don't know what to do anymore.",depression

well, everything i ever looked forward to was taken from me and at this point i think the universe is trying to tell me something.

i'm in the mental state to do it, my body is just being a coward. everytime i try my survival instincts kick in and stop me. can't hang myself because my instincts kick in and i struggle like hell, even though i want it to happen. 

give me something that'll stick with me long enough for it to happen, or just a quick and efficient way to get the job done.

i don't really care about pain at this point because it's worth it, and dealing with the mental pain is worse and lasts longer than the physical pain anyways. still, if anyone has any quick, painless way to do it, that would be appreciated.",depression

Whenever we do talk, the conversation is short lived, and she takes her sweet goddamn time to respond to me. Eventually she'll say she has to do something or stop responding to me which pisses me off (randomly not responding, not her needing to do something). I've always asked her if she could start convos with me more and she always says sorry and then gives me a dumbass excuse. I'm starting to think their lies just so she can avoid me. The last time we talked was October 29th and i said something like ""still wanna watch that movie on halloween? also why u sleep so much"" (i said that last bit as a joke, cuz it was like 6am and i was still awake) and she left me read.

157589,"Am I being selfish really? They may grieve but in the end they will be free of my burdenI've found myself very much alone. Less than standing in a room full of people and feeling alone. More recently even the room is empty now and I truly am alone. I can't talk to anyone. My auntie had leukemia my mum has lymphoma, I don't know where my sister is and my dad doesn't want to hear or understand. My friends have thier lives panning out for them and don't need me bringing them down. I've been banned (through no fault of my own) from a social club that was my only escape for a month when I could really have done with the support and friends there and going back nothing is the same, I feel judged and excluded. I'm on medication but what's the point... It does nothing. I'm on a wait list for intensive cbt... But that's a 9 month wait. When I was under the start of cbt I said I had suicidal thoughts and even though I did I felt like I could control it. Stop myself. Or that I wouldn't really do anything anyway.

Today was the 3rd day in a row I've picked up meds and seriously thought about it. The difference in today was I popped the Mills from the blister pack into my hand. I stared at them for a long time. I was going to do it. I still might but there's something that I promised from the start was to try my lifelines. So I'm trying something different in the hopes that someone may listen to me for once and understand. I don't feel like I have anything left to live for. Even my dad who is my world. I feel like he does r want to be here anymore and if there's no him what's the point. And I'd rather go first than be left to face life without him. I don't want to get better at this point... It doesn't seem appealing. But I don't want to be in this position at the same time. I just wish I had someone to hug me and tell me they understand rather than tell me I need to do something. I do everything for everyone else and neglect my own life that's mostly why I'm in this situation.

I just want to be loved, I want someone next to me to get me through life. And make me feel warm. And appreciated and a part of thier life that's important rather than always feeling like I'm disposable like I'm irrelevant and unnecessary.

203611,"a last resort I guessI’m not sure how to start this off, it’s a bit weird since this is the first time I’ve been on Reddit. I feel like I don’t have anyone to turn to. There’s a lot on my mind and a lot that I want to say, but that would take too long. I guess I’ve just gotten to the extreme low point of depression, anxiety, stress, low self esteem, to where I don’t think I want help anymore. I’ve been suicidal for so long now, and I started cutting again. Each time the cuts get deeper and I’m always tempted to try killing myself with pills. The only thing keeping me here anymore is the fear of failure, but even that is starting to slip away. I keep skipping school because of the immense stress and anxiety it gives me, and because I keep missing assignments. It’s hard being around people, especially family who don’t understand, and it’s hard being alone on my own. I’m not sure what I’ll gain by venting on reddit, but it’s a nice way to be fully honest and not have to pretend like I’m ok. I plan on killing myself eventually and I’m not sure when, but soon. I don’t believe that life is worth living when all I’ve been doing for 5 years is this. Just nothing other than being a complete mental fuck up. I’m debating whether or not to kill myself today with tylenol and just get it over with. I’ve had enough with stalling and wondering which day is the one I’ll snap. It’s so hard living and I’ve just been crying nonstop about everything on my mind. I’m sorry to anyone who cares about me, which I’m pretty sure is just a few people.

We lived there, both working at the nursing home full time and living with a great roommate. Then, the roommate had her boyfriend come over. He turned out to be a meth head. He convinced my Bailee to try some, and she left me for him. She quit her job and he was homeless, so she told him to move in. She descended and descended, slowly ripping out my heart. Eventually I moved hours away to go college. I've known other meth heads. There's always that ""last message"" you get from them where they're begging for your help. Thing is, she knows I know people, and she begged me to help her by putting a hit out on her. Of course I said no and begged her to let me help her. I haven't heard from her since, but after some searching I found out her ex boyfriend (the meth head) is in rehab. She just kinda dropped off the map. I've seen it before, and I'll see it again. She's dead, and she's not coming back. She was my one true love, I used to call her Babu. She would call me Bebo. She would ruin the day of anyone who hated on us for being together, or on me for being trans. She was so beautiful. My Bailee was so fucking beautiful.

25059,"Upset about my lifeFor the past years in college, I've been alone and I've been content with it. I sat down and played video games or watched TV whenever I got free time from work and school. Basically, oscillating between the two. Didn't bother me much. 

I'm not bad with people. Whenever I'm in a group with someone in class or at work, I usually can make great conversations with them. Unfortunately, I do not keep in close contact after class or work and I don't make any real friendships. I'm so angry I don't do that. 

It doesn't mean I've never made any friends. One of which I talked to everyday in class but I didn't do well in that class cuz I was talking with him constantly and I did not really talk that much to him anymore.

Due to all this, I haven't had a friendly conversation with some face to face in like 2 months (not to talk about work). I feel so lonely and empty. Also I was dragged on a trip with my family and a bunch of old people for fifteen days. I feel like that affected my mental health severely. I don't like to talk to people a lot older than me.

Last thing and probably the most important, I've been recently reading stories of victims of mass shootings and being captured by terroristic organizations. Reading about these beautiful people dedicating their causes to religious organizations and helping people, only to die in a horrific fate at such a young age made me cry. It makes me reflect on what useless sack of shit I am and the world would be better off if they were on earth and not me. 

Sorry if this came out as disorganized, trying to organize my thoughts it difficult right now, a lot is going on.

234760,"I tried using sanitizer as lube and oh lord it burns **TL;DR :It made my balls burn. Dont try it. Even if you're desperate, just use something safe.**

So.. Last night i couldn't sleep. I was beyond horny. I was Ultra horny and i needed to rub one out. But wait, It's dry af. Can't get off when i'm dry as heck (I'm a guy btw, i need my dong to feel moist i guess)

Usually, i use aloe vera as a lube. Natural, Environmentally friendly, and it's perfect. But i ran out somewhere in august. We keep aloe vera for burn treatment incase someone gets a burn, and nobody sussed me for finishing it. Nobody is buying since we don't really need it.

I have this bottle of sanitizer. Not liquid, but it's a gel. Made of, you guessed it, aloe vera. I thought, Hey It's aloe. It won't hurt. Maybe the alcohol will give a nice cooling feel. I shuffled across the room, not creaking a single floorboard. Got some sanitizer and lay down on me bed. I rubbed it all over me dong, and ohh loordddd it felt great. The cooling feel was a 10/10. I felt something trickle on to my balls... It was slow and in a matter of seconds, felt like it was on fire.

Now, If you want to know that burning feel, hold your hand over some boiling water for 2 mins and the way the steam hurts, is the same way my balls hurt. It burned like heck. It felt like it was about to fall off 

I raced to the bathroom and washed it off with cold water and the burning momentarily stopped. I checked for chemical burns (i'm a man of science) and i'm all clear. It looked like i went for a swim and it was shrivelled up. it kept burning for a while so i checked again and i was clear. My dong felt A-Okay but the family jewels felt like it went through fire and flames, to hell and back, into the forge, whatever it did.

It's morning, 7hrs later random patches on me balls burn but doesnt hurt. I'm fine so far but i ended up getting off anyways coz i used lotion. Tho aloe is the best lube. Lotion doesnt feel nice like aloe. Heck aloe also has a natural cooling effect but dang.. Don't use sanitizer. ever. Even if you're hecking desperate",non-depression
164688,"I can't take it anymoreIt just seems like my life is in deep black abyss of suffering and hopelessness. I've never felt so alone. It keeps getting worse and worse. ""It Gets Better"" doesn't seem to apply to me. It's so hard not break out into tears on a day to day basis. I'm autistic. I can't even look anyone in the eyes. It's too painful, it feels like I'm starring into the sun. I'm always starring into the ground when I walk. And when I look up my eyes automatically lock onto someone else's eye, I can't control it. And then I just automatically look away in sheepish shame, my eyes can't help but flicker away. I wish I could read body language. I wish I could know what someone was thinking or feeling just by looking at them. I wish I could just talk to someone and exchange our views and ideas about things. I want to know what other people have to say about things. I know what I should say but my brain won't allow me to say it. I feel like my brain is a prison and that my mind is in solitary confinement. I feel like my heart is being brutally stabbed and that blood just keeps flowing into it without purpose. The pain is too great for me to bear anymore. My poor neurotic mind is tearing itself apart. 

It hurts that I'm so good looking and yet so insecure and lacking in confidence because of my broken mind, It's almost like some divine being gave me good physical genetics and inferior mental genetics as a good laugh laugh. I guess the guy upstairs has an ironic sense of humor. I didn't always used to be like this. I used to not have an Asperger's diagnosis, people liked me and thought I was funny, I was confident and sure of myself. I used to always know my life would be perfect, or at least I thought it would be. Now I'm the complete opposite, I'm anxious and ashamed of myself. I thought about stabbing myself in the leg earlier just to feel, I punched myself in the ribcage repeatably instead, that way if I ever escape my suffering I won't have a physical reminder of my sins. I just wish I could speak to Kenzie while being able to look into her eyes. She's so beautiful, it's like her blonde hair was made from sunshine. I know she at least likes me. She has hinted at me twice to take her to Homecoming before. One day she even asked me if I was OK. I wasn't but I said I was anyway. No one ever did that before, she made my day and the rest of my year. If I told her some of the things I was telling now I know she would at least listen. She's no stranger to anxiety or depression either. She's kinder than most people. 

Most of my ""friends"" are mean to me and put me down and make fun of me. I hate them. One of them constantly calls me stupid, I think he's mean because he's jealous of my good looks and the attention I get from them. It's just too bad I'm too useless to get anything with my looks, too autistic. I feel like I'm a waste of space, I feel like I contaminate the oxygen in the air. My school would hate it if I killed myself, too many people kill themselves already. The school has a bad reputation for suicide. A girl that always liked me tried to kill herself with blood pressure meds recently, I want to talk to her about it when she comes back but I don't know how. I probably won't as it would feel to rigid and awkward to get past small talk. I could just say what I want to say but I don't know that would go over. I feel like if people don't respond to me positively my brain registers it as negative, I hate myself. I wish I could remember an inspirational quote about overcoming my circumstances but my memory is so bad it won't allow me too. I feel like that guy in the Metallica sone One. I either have to bullshit, cheat, or cram to get sufficient grades and I hate it. I hate that I have no coherence in my sentence pattern. My attention is horrid also, I can't even read a book. I wish I could at least read a book. I think I might try drugs one day, that way I'll feel the warm sunshine upon my life temporarily and not the cold, black endless suffering. 

There's a shotgun in my house if I ever need it. I might have to use it soon, I hope not though. I can't tell my Psychologist this or else I would be institutionalized because I have an easy access to firearms and know exactly where I'm going to pull the trigger in my neighborhood.

207304,"I've lost my only emotional help, had a seizure last night, and I'm completely over the brink.I have severe social anxiety and agoraphobia as well as major depression.

I made huge progress with social anxiety and the agoraphobia over the past 12 months, which has recently almost completely backslid due to COVID 19. I work in a hospital and take public transport and I've been more and more terrified of leaving the house as days go on

The only thing I've been relying on is my wireless earbuds, they gave me a new lease on life and cut down almost completely on hypervigilance and panic when I'm out in public.

Last night I realised I misplaced them at someone's house or their car, they would have fallen out of my handbag. I messaged and asked them to search (I can't go back there for two weeks maybe longer) and they couldn't find them and weren't too interested in looking harder. 

I have to be back at the hospital tomorrow morning at 8am. I can't face leaving the house and I'm just completely finished. The headphones aren't something I can replace, they're $70 and I don't have that money to spare. I have less in my bank account. I also start wailing and sobbing at the thought of even leaving the house to go to the shops. 

I can't take time off work. I'm barely holding off self harm. I have epilepsy and had a stress induced seizure, now I feel like a truck has hit me. I feel bad for my neighbours because I've been sobbing and wailing on and off for hours now. I bit through my cheek during the seizure and I'm still spitting blood.

I again messaged the person who's house my headphones are at to explain how important these are and tried calling them, they've seen my messages but not replied or returned my call.

I am afraid of feeling pain before dying, thats why i need a gun tbh. I've also considered shocking myself with wires but you dont die instantly from that, do you ?

I dont trust in any religions, death is only for me the fact of ""not existing"". Here's my question, why should i exist when i can simply not exist? Why should i keep on feeling pain when i could simply not exist ?
When i red of those posts about people having a lot of troubles in their lifes i felt like the problem a 17 yo guy is supposed to be nothing compared to them. But i mean here i am asking myself why i'm alive when i could be dead ? Lets admit i just gotta wait 5 years so i can finaly enjoy life or whatever.

I'm drunk while writing this, so sorry for miswritings. I'm a successful guy at university, age 20, suffering depression, skin picking, alcohol and lately tobacco. I'm taking antidepressents and seeing a psychiatrist, however never sad anything when they asked about suicide. I'm done with it, even though I'm social, I can never find a girlfriend. And dont give the ""you will have one and laugh at this, I have seen many people not having any at all. I'm done with people saying I'm already social and find someone. Most of my friends have someone and I never did. 

I dont believe and find life meaningless. I'm already successful, yet nothing goes good. I always had similar thoughts, however lately I cannot stop them. I already fight with skin picking, artefacta dermatitis, and my legs are full of scars I did. Every time someone asks me the scars, I die more inside and say they are allergies. 

Nearly all of my friends nearly all of the time have a sweetheart, yet regardless of how much I try, I can't even date anyone. I have many close friends, yet I dont have any friend that I can we are closest friends. I'm done with everything this life can offer, it will never be better.

Antidepressants, not that powerful ones, seemed nice when they started effecting, but now they seem useless. My psyc postponed my therapy since I wont be at my uni town for the next month, and she doesnt want it to end in half. 

Every where I look says suicide is bad, but I hate these taboos. Why not end it if I believe there is nothing after the life, why not end the suffering at once. I hate the headaches of loneliness, for I have many friends, none I can find at the time I need them most.

I dont want to deal with no mean comments. Currently i am 20 years old and in the year 2015 i dropped out of high school as a sophomore because my frustration with school got the best of me. It was a really stupid idea i understand and i really regret it from the negative outcome and the anxiety it has give me. I am extremely anti social to the point were my mind with the real world is gone and i get really scared with anxiety to step out of my house which is my comfort zone and meet people or even step out to go to stores.

I never have had a real job were i apply and i am scared my anxiety always holds me back to step outside my house. Money is a serious problem with me i always end up wasting it all instead of saving it for something useful in my future. My all day routine is to be on my phone, Tv, eat, shower, and sleep and do the same thing over and over again everyday. I basically only go out somewhere like the nearby stores for only two times a week or just be in my friends house and stay inside there for the weekends for sleepovers. I know i will be judged because im not independent but i just cant help myself no more but tell the world how really serious depressed i am.

108235,"Had a breakdown at college, returned home, feeling zero motivation to start overJust a heads up: this is really, really long. I'm worried there's too much exposition to actually belong on r/SuicideWatch. If so I'm deeply sorry and please point me in a direction where this is better suited. I've never told anyone my full story or dealings with suicide and depression— at least, not the entire, whole truth. I was hoping this subreddit could listen.

So a bit of a backstory on me. I graduated from my high school with a 95 GPA. My whole life I was in  advanced classes, and always did my best. I took piano lessons, played soccer, took Chinese lessons outside of school, held down a part-time job at a local farm, was a secretary for my school's computer club, and still managed to go out with friends from time to time. I loved to draw and write, and I was considered the ""artsy"" girl with a quirky sense of humor at school. I wasn't popular, but I had some friends that were and some friends that weren't, and that was perfect for me.

But things only seemed outwardly okay. In reality, I'd been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was 13. To be honest... I have no idea how I managed it. I just don't think I ever confronted my feelings or problems in life. I simply stuffed them down, ignoring what was going on... brushing off suicidal feelings as normal, okay. I was in therapy and on meds and, for the most part, played my role as the ""perfect daughter"". Note that filling that role was really important to me. It was ingrained into me from a young age that I had no choice to be perfect (for multiple reasons). My brother Matthew was autistic, and my parents spent most of their days taking care of him. I was allistic, educated, independent, talkative— the polar opposite of Matt. And please understand, I don't hold any resentment towards him, because I love my little bro so so much, and have ended friendships because they treated my brother badly because of his autism. I wouldn't change him for the world. But the truth of the matter is, he got so much more nuturing and attention as a child than I did. It became a mantra in my head that my needs weren't as important as others' needs. To make matters worse, I also had family members that were kinda, er... delinquents? I guess that's the word I'm going with. They got in legal trouble and didn't take the ""traditional"" route of going to college, getting a job— they just caused a lot of conflict and stress. I saw my grandma cry over them. I was afraid that I would become like them... someone that just mooched off their family and shit in the face of everyone that cared. So I decided from a very young age I'd be perfect. I'd cause no trouble, I'd get straight-A's, I'd play a sport and an instrument and become a polyglot and an artist and a part-time novelist with a degree in international relations from a 60k/yr private school. And I didn't allow myself any room for compromise.

Things started becoming less manageable when I was 15. I think I cut for the first time then, but quickly stopped because I got caught, thankfully. Either way, I had serious self-esteem problems like every normal teen. I developed dermatillomania then, which is a nervous condition brought on by my OCD where I picked incessantly at my skin. Like, 24/7. Mostly at my hands, nails, scabs, and acne, where I'd peel off the skin until it bled. But I also ripped up my back. I would sit in front of the mirror every night in secret for 1+ hours staring at my skin, searching for imperfections, making myself bleed and actually cry from the pain. I wasn't sad, but my eyes watered because it hurt too bad. I don't know. Looking back, I think it was a coping mechanism... it destressed me and it gave me control over my body, which was (in my view) ugly, awkward, ridden with acne, and drugged-up on meds that seemed not to even help.

The dermatillomania got better when I was 17 because my acne went away thanks to accutane. But my condition worsened. Suicidal feelings were constant, oppressive, and sucked all the joy out of my life. I quit soccer and started having difficultly attenting school. Then piano went. Then my club activity died out and I stopped seeing friends. I didn't draw much anymore, barely wrote— except for depressing poetry that made me feel a little relief, if just at the moment. I started binge-watching tons more anime and became more of a shut-in. My brother's needs got more complex as he grew and people were less understanding, more harsh. My parents argued a lot. Threw stuff. They said awful things and did awful things, most of which I forgot intentionally. I can't really... blame them or hate them, long term. They love me, I love them, and they tried to parent me best they could. But having two mentally ill kids— one also developmentally disabled— well, it put a lot of strain on them. My mom struggled with anxiety and depression, and my dad was angry and frustrated. Days I couldn't get out of bed they'd scream at me and drag me by my feet or grab my hair and shake my head until I fell out of the bed. I would just externally shut down and go limp and they'd call me fucked up and stuff, and ask what happened to me. I didn't have an answer. It was like I broke! And I wanted to die more than ever.

Around my 18th birthday (so March 2016) it was the worst. My attentance rate at school had dropped. I would miss weeks at a time. My parents would vaccillate between loving parents and abusers who screamed obscenities and shook me like a rag doll. Anyways, I had exhausted med choices and I'd seen therapists and psychiatrists. So I was hospitalized because I ""wasn't functioning"". I was miserable at the hospital but oddly, at peace. I was diagnosed bipolar and they gave me new meds. When I got out I started attending group therapy and slowly but surely returned to doing schoolwork, mostly outside of classes but occasionally I'd go to a class or two. I was sort-of functioning. I didn't enjoy anything in life anymore but I got through, ya know? I forgot what it was like to enjoy writing or drawing or just life in general, but I was... managing.

I graduated (barely) and walked across the stage to receive my degree. I had a handful of very supportive friends who helped me become more social again. And now that I was free of high school, I felt like a huge burden had been lifted from my chest! I was free! My family was kinder to me. I felt less like a failure. I went to therapy twice a week and visited my psychiatrist for med evaluations monthly. I wasn't a huge fan of my meds— I still felt pretty ""blah"" about life— but I ignored that. 

Um... I don't know how to sugar-coat the next bit of this. My cat died. My cat was my best friend, and the only one I really had who I felt fully supported me. Laugh if you want, but he was my biggest comfort. When my dad made me cry I'd sob into his fur until my tears dried, and my lovely kitty would lick the salt from my face and just purr. One time, I was going to attempt suicide, when my cat knocked over the pill bottles I had lined up in front of me. He then rubbed against my hand and made me pet him, forcing me to also put down the pill bottle I held in my hand. I took it as a sign and didn't kill myself that day, thankfully.

Losing him was a big loss but my entire past YEAR had felt like one devastation after another, so I handled it okay. I cried it out.

Shortly after I had an opportunity to study abroad in Spain (I studied Spanish in school and was pretty good at it), and I took it, flying by myself all the way from JFK to Madrid! It was an amazing experience. I was proud to have flown individually. I was depressed during my stay (especially because of my cat) and I worried my host family a bit, but I did my best to enjoy it. 

I returned home. And you know, I realized, in the moments when I stopped ruminating and overthinking life, I felt... really, really alive. Like when my friends and I went to Denny's at 3 am and then ran around in a nature preserve, before crashing in my basement to watch bad movies. I fell in love for the first time and he lit up my world. I don't think I'd ever been that happy in my life, or at least not since I've been 13.

But the next stage in our lives was approaching. I forgot to mention above, but while I did not get accepted to an expensive private school, I did get in to the #1 state school in my state. I was proud. Excited. Scared, because of my meltdown senior year of high school. But I was ready to face it... even though I didn't want my summer to end.

I left my boyfriend at home and we decided to just be friends because he was a year younger and I was going 3 hours away. Not a huge deal, but it also wasn't ideal to start a long-distance relationship after being romantically involved for just a few days.

When I got to college I was nervous like everyone at first, but I attacked it like my old self. I joined co-rec football and made lots of friends! I did laundry, fed myself, made my bed— the little victories. Things I couldn't do 6 months ago. I was damn proud. I missed my cat and to a lesser extent, my boyfriend, but whatever! I was managing. I came home for a weekend and it was surprisingly nice to see my family, something I hadn't felt in a while. My brother sort-of hugged me, which was a huuuge deal. I returned to college confident.

But when I went to the classes... I fell apart. I was too anxious to do the coursework. Everything overwhelmed me and I suddenly regressed and shut down, just like last March. I left on medical leave and returned home, dropping all my friends, and putting my future on hold.

Now I have to start over. I lost all my old therapists and psychologists and psychiatrists, my parents are back to their weird abusive/loving/flip-flopping selves, and all I do is sleep. I've never been this miserable in my life. I have no ambition— I don't even know if I want to get better. I got a job at a daycare (keep in mind I love kids) but I just... never finished filling out the forms, and now I'm in limbo, debating if I'm even stable enough to hold a job. I do nothing. My cat is dead. I'm lonely, isolated, tired, and starting to realize that my family isn't going to help me ""recover"". It's gotta come from within, and I'm broken.

I'm going to a therapist and a psychiatrist... I'm trying to pick up reading and writing and drawing again, I've been even playing a little piano and learning the ukulele, trying to spark some interest. But I've got nothing. 

I know getting a job would help. I also think getting a new cat would be really therapeutic, and if I pushed the issue enough I'm certain my parents'll eventually cave. But... is that what I want? What about going back to college? Am I ever gonna have that life I dreamed of? When did I become the problem child?

I just want to kill myself. I'm so, so tired. I'm not even scared of dying anymore. Just... alone.

The only good thing in my life is my boyfriend, who I'm back with now that I'm home again. Our 1 month anniversary of us since I got home (and what we consider the official start of our relationship) is October 3rd. I love him. That's naive to say probably, but I do. He makes me forget my sadness.

I... I don't know anymore. I'm so sick of this constant depression... I just want it to end. I want to die and leave this world. I want to stop being a burden and a fuck up and a failure. And I'm so lonely!!! Everyone in my life has left me behind and all I have is a disappointed family. And my mom says having me around makes her depression worse. So I just want to finally end my life. I'm sorry this is so long, but I feel so relieved. I've never told anyone the whole story before.",depression

292371,"Chronic Disease SuffererHello,

I'm a 40 year old male who at the age of 25 was struck down with an undiagnosed disease that has left me dizzy and with a headache (along with several other symptoms) every minute of every day since.  

In other words, for the last 15 years, I've had a headache, dizziness, imbalance, cognitive issues 24x7x365.  I've been to numerous doctors and have had countless tests and nobody knows whats wrong with me.  

In the past 15 years, I've done the best that I've could to maintain an upbeat perspective, hoping that one day somebody will find out what's wrong with me and be able to provide some form of treatment but here I am 15 years later and my condition has just gotten worse.  I've probably tried close to 100 different meds and none have worked.

I worry incessantly about my job.  I worry that I may not even be able to get out of bed tomorrow.  

I've tried several anti-depressants, both pharmaceutical-grade and natural and have they do little to improve my outlook.  I cannot escape the headache and numerous other symptoms that plague me 24x7.    

Honestly, I just can't see myself being an old man and feeling like this.  My energy level is just wiped out fighting to get through the day (because of the illness).  If it wasn't for this physical illness, I would probably be ok.  I have a pretty good tolerance for pain (both physical and emotional) but my body and mind is giving out and I'm not sure what to do.  

I think of suicide, on average, about every 5 minutes or so.  I can't get it out of my head.  I just don't know how much longer I can take this physical illness.  It bears down on me so.  I'm also an atheist-I gave up on praying at about year 10 or so into this.  It doesn't work.

I will say this.  To all of those who post on here who are going through problems, take a step back and see that most of the time, your problem is temporary.  Being 40, I've been through quite a bit and have seen my share of good times and bad times.  The emotional bad times come and go.  If you find yourself clinging on to these emotional bad times, get medicated.  If you have your health, be thankful.  

The absolute worst thing in the world is be have health problems.  My particular issues have plagued me since I was 25 and has robbed me of so much life, yet I persevered.

Other people who agree with me have a problem with the Yana Perrault being buttercup for the wrong reason. They think they're gonna make her the ""angry black woman of the group"" which to me, I don't think the CW would be that stupid (I hope) and speaking of the ""angry black woman"" stereotype. Something tells me that they're gonna try and have a arc or episode tackling that. Which knowing the CW, they'll fuck up. And it wouldn't even make sense for Buttercup's character at all.

90051,"I just feel like I'm here to keep people happy...Hey all. I'm posting because I just keep getting closer and closer to finally ending everything... 

I've been depressed for a long time, but I had one of the one nights in a while yesterday, and I keep thinking of just ending it all now and getting it over with. I've got a lot of issues, don't like who I am, in my 20's and live at home, I'm an alcoholic, had a lot of bad things happen in the last few years. My best friend killed himself a couple of weeks ago without any warning too.

I'm used to being depressed, but last night I went on my work night out. I've previously told my colleague I have feelings for her and was turned down. I'm absolutely fine with that, I'm not complaining about being rejected, shit happens. Last night though, our night out got messy. I spent the last couple of hours looking after other people who were a mess, making sure they had taxis home, getting them water, picking them up when they fall or pass out. All that time, my work colleague who calls herself my work wife is getting with another one of our colleagues. 

I know it's the right thing to do, I should look after other people when they need help, I honestly have no problem with her getting with who she wants, she's not leading me on, but we all left the bar, I'd been putting others in taxis, making sure they had a way home or were okay making it back, and I'm left there all by myself. I spent so long trying to look after other people when I'm so low myself, and my reward is loneliness again, while everybody I know walks off. I just walked home 7 miles just crying, not a single person text me to see if I was okay or if I found a way home... I tried to hard to help other people when I'm so desperately low, and my reward is watching someone I care about get with someone else, and then being left on my own. 

I'm not saying I'm going to kill myself over one bad night, but I've lost so much recently, I don't remember the last time I was happy, and I don't want to keep having more days like this.

197213,"I don't want to be an adult.Hi all.

I'm autistic.  I don't know if this has anything to do with the following or not, but I think it does, which is why I mention it: I can't think about anything but the present.  I don't think about the past, I don't think about the future.  I struggle to process what's going on in the here and now, and that's about all I can handle.  If I try to make goals about the future or make plans and all that, I get overwhelmed, confused, and I generally have meltdowns, which I like to avoid at all costs.   So no thinking about the future.

Anyways, I'm also 24.  It's time for me to be responsible.  I'm starting a doctoral degree next semester.  I'm having money troubles, and it's worse than ever.  I've been excited about going to Cedar Point since I haven't ridden a roller coaster in years, and I fucking love roller coasters.  This has been a plan with two of my best friends (best because I've been friends with them for more than a year actively, which is very uncommon for me) for half a year now.  I've been so fucking excited about it.

If I go on this trip, I may struggle to pay a bill, and I'm going to have to skip it because of that.  I talked with my mom about it and she says that as an adult you'll have to make sacrifices like this all the time.  I'm beginning to feel this.  This past year, I've been excited about many things, and every single one I've had to give up or have been let down by.  Every single one.  My mom says this is fairly common.  Bills become your priority.  Struggling to make ends meet.  Sacrificing the present in order to have a good future.

The present is all I fucking have.  I can't think about the future.  I struggle to think about the present.  If I sacrifice the present, it'll be giving up the only thing I have.  I don't work toward goals.  I don't have delayed gratification or whatever.  I can't handle this.  I don't want to think about living another day.  I just drove to the top of an 8-story parking garage and sat there for a bit before deciding that today was not the day.

I''m so fucking bad at just being a normal human adult.  I don't want it.  I don't want to sacrifice my present.  It's all I've been doing for a whole year.  A whole year without any sort of pleasure or release whatsoever.  If I could think ""oh, I'm just working toward my future,"" I feel like it would all be worth it, but that doesn't mean anything to me.  I don't understand that.  I can only process what's happening right now.

I hate this so much.  I hate myself, I hate this, I hate being an adult, I hate being responsible, I hate my life, and I don't want it anymore.  I've never really wanted it.  I've never wanted to be alive.  I've never wanted to be dead, but I've never wanted to be alive either.  Now I want to be dead.  I'm going to keep driving to the top of that garage until one day I can get myself to sit on the ledge.  Then I'm going to keep doing that until I can swing my legs over.  Then I'm going to keep doing that until I just finally lean forward and give up.  It's the only thought that keeps me going.  That someday I'll give in and I won't have to think anymore.",depression

One wrong step, or one word spoken in a tone they saw as ""disrespectful"" and that was it.  The yelling and hitting started again.  I had no idea how to talk to other kids.  I couldn't laugh or play or have fun because I didn't know how to.  So I just stayed quiet.  My dad left when I was around 11.  Never saw him again.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 6th grade, I started trying to talk to other kids.  I started trying to see how the whole ""making friends"" thing worked.  I guess I was very awkward and weird, and kids hate awkward and weird.  It also didn't help that even though I tried really hard to keep the home clean (with no help from anyone else in the house) I smelled like cat piss.  No matter what I did.  

&amp;#x200B;

In middle school, I learned very quickly that I am apparently extremely unattractive.  There was a girl that lived down the street from me.  I never had a crush on her or anything but I tried to make friends with her brother.  She always made it a point to let me know how ""not cute"" I was.  ""That's just one girl"" you might be thinking.  But all through high school and college I never got any feedback that made me think any differently.  

&amp;#x200B;

I never learned how to make friends.  Never learned how to make bonds with people.  So I was on my own pretty much the whole time.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 2006 or 2007 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  I Didn't really know how to think for myself of make my own decisions, so I stayed with her.  Drove her to chemo and the Canter Treatment Center.  I slaved in her apartment, just like when I was a child.  I cleaned up after her, did her bandages.  Caregiver stuff.  She was still so mean.  Around then was when I started to figure out what depression was.  I just had a thought one day.  ""What if I was dead?""  I didn't really know what to make of it at the time.  But it was a thought that would never leave my mind.  Always there.  

&amp;#x200B;

I had what I think was a nervous breakdown in 2009.  I don't know exactly what it was but I had never felt that way before.  It was as if the safety net that held my mind in place just disappeared.  I did something I never thought I would do.  I asked my mom for help.  For advice.  She called me crazy.  Said ""I always knew you were nuts.""  This triggered an anger in me I had never felt before.  I left.  I moved in with these guys I knew.  They made me pay half the rent by myself and they would just pay small portions.  They didn't let me live there out of concern, they just wanted the money.  I put pretty much all of the money I made at my shit job into living there.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was away from my mother for the first time in my life.  I would have nightmares of her pounding on my door and slamming it open, raging into my room.  I would have nightmares about the filthy house I lived in as a child and the apartment I had lived in with my mother only recently.  I couldn't interact normally with the guys I lived with.  I just expected them to do the same things to me my family did.  They left me alone, though.  They were completely indifferent to me.  I had an asthma attack for some reason while I was there and none of them even bat an eye.  I drove myself to the hospital, almost completely unable to breathe.  

&amp;#x200B;

I left them in 2011 and moved to a city.  Lived completely on my own.  The freedom was intoxicating.  I had another shit job, but it was okay.  No one was mad at me all the time.  No one telling me I am worthless.  But I'm not very good at anything I do.  One day I was trying really hard at work but apparently I wasn't doing a good enough job.  I was told to go home and not come back the next day.  I had no idea what to do.  I lost my job, and was going to lose my apartment.  So..I moved back to my old town.  With my mother.  I used the little growing up I did to completely close myself off.  By this point, it was around 2015.  I helped my mother again.  She was emotionally abusive as usual but I lost the ability to be phased by it.  I couldn't feel anything.  

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up moving out and moving in with one of the guys I used to live with before I moved the city.  My mother went septic in December 2017.  I was the one who called the ambulance.  I was there for her.  Even knowing she was never there for me.  I didn't shed a tear.  Not one.  I thought I was supposed to be sad losing my mother, but I didn't feel anything.  I lost the job I had shortly after.  I don't even remember why.  It was most likely my own fault though.  My room mate will be kicking me out soon.  The town I live in has a horribly high unemployment rate making it very hard to find work.  So I am at my end here.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 32 years old.  I have never had a real friend.  The only family I knew hated me from the moment I was born.  I have never been shown affection of any kind.  No one has ever said ""I love you"" to me.  Or ""I'm proud of you"".  I have never done anything worth being proud of, though, so I guess that's okay.  I have come to the conclusion that my mother was absolutely right.  I am worthless.  Useless.  A complete waste of life.  I have tried so hard in so many different ways but everything has failed.  Before people start the judgement spree, I know.  I know all of this is my own fault.  I should never have moved back in with my mother.  I know all the things I shouldn't have done.  I get it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can't afford help.  Suicide posts are always saying things like ""talk to your friends!"" or ""get help!""  But I have no friends to talk to.  There is no help to get.  I sit here in my room all day, every day.  I clean the things that need cleaning around the house, but I don't go outside anymore.  I have gone multiple days without speaking a single word.  Sleep is a nightmare.  When I lay down, my heart freaks out.  My whole body feels like static and my heart skips beats all over the place.  I saw a doctor in the local ER but he said it's just anxiety and sent me home.  Who am I do doubt a medical professional?  So I'm lost there too.  When I actually DO fall asleep I have constant nightmares and sleep paralysis is very common.  I want it to end.  And I am very likely going to end it very soon.  I hate literally everything about myself.  I know there are millions of people who have it worse than me.  I get it.  I know there's nothing about me that matters, which is why I have never reached out to anyone before.  This is the first time I have spoken like this.  But I am sitting here in my room, staring at the rope I plan to use, trying one last time.

334632,"I know it's trite, but literally nobody likes me.This is difficult. Because either what I'm saying is true and I'm an abhorrent individual, or literally every person in my life is a narcissist using me as a step stool to feel taller. It's been happening so long I can't even figure out the cause and effect anymore. But even when I try to be kind, or communicate effectively, my efforts are very much rebuffed. I know when I get anxious I shut down, and then I short circuit when I'm being gaslit (I think? I don't know!!! The confusion is the worst part!!!) 

I just want to be gone so everyone isn't so bothered by me. My parents hate me, my boyfriend hates me, the rest of my family hates me. Anyone I've ever been friends with, without exception, have taken advantage of me, backstabbed me, stolen from me, or destroyed things I loved out of spite, just for me being me, in one instance, standing up for my daughter, in another, someone ELSE'S daughter. These are not exaggerations, and these are not ideas or impressions I have drawn upon in my own head. These are verifiable facts and real words and actions that have been witnessed. 

All of the people I say hate me have said as much, repeatedly. But when I ask for reasons why I get vague things like ""you're a bitch"" or projections of the problems I've brought up with them in the past. Depression and PPD have also wreaked havoc with me this past year, which means lately I get called gross, lazy, unfit mother (and this is just from my mom- she hates that I'm ok with clutter, and showering is my impossible thing sometimes) 

I have also not been an angel in my life. I have retaliated at times. I have a mouth like a sailor. When hurt or cornered I can be like a bear. I speak my mind to my own detriment at times. Socially I'm pretty retarded. But whenever I know I have caused pain all I want to do is fix it. 

I'm not sure if I'm crazy, they're crazy, we're ALL crazy, or if I'm just broken and need to disappear, amputating the broken limb from the healthy whole. Because I don't see any other way out. I can't keep a job, because I put out instant hate me vibes everywhere I go, so I don't have any money, I just want to curl up and give up. I've got nothing left. I'm so tired. ",depression

One song came on, and I pretty much enjoyed the tune. I clicked the heart on the screen to add it to Liked songs, and check it out later.

I don’t want to come off as selfish or greedy but my clothes are becoming to expensive.

Me being a tall and big teenager has its pros and cons. One of its cons is the rate at which I grow through clothing and the cost of clothing. The cost of clothing for someone my size is around $50 dollars for a pair of jeans and I usually need five pairs of khakis and jeans which will cost my family around $300 dollars just for pants if we are shopping in clearance and we usually need to go clothes shopping twice a year for clothes for me. But during quarantine my family has been facing financial issues and this has caused me to not get enough clothes to the point to which I have to wear some twice in a row and wear my clothes that don’t fit(currently it’s just the pants but now my shirts and underwear are now becoming too tight). The problem with this is I go back to school tomorrow in person and I only have one pair of pants that fit and my schedule is wack so I go to the school up to four times a week when I’m only suppose to being twice a week.
So I’ve been faced with the issue of what to do, my family has put it two ways for me. I ether wear clothes that don’t fit multiple times a weeks or I must be put on a strict diet to make me lose weight to the point which clothes are big on me.

Born in Arizona to military family. Immediately moved to Hawaii. Went to preschool and kindergarten there. Also got Crash Bandicoot trilogy for the PS1 from my Hawaiian Studies teacher. 

Moved back to Arizona for elementary school. Can't remember much besides the best golden retriever ever. Also break my wrist riding on the handlebars of Sister 1's bike. 

Moved to Southern Virginia. Mom went crazy from sometime around here due to a severe case of glaucoma. She quit her job and sat at home. She's doing better, just got a new job in her 50s. Sister 1 got a little Yorkshire Terrier, skipped a bunch of hillbilly high school to watch Maury and try drugs. She's doing better. Golden Retriever suffered through puppy Yorkie while she slowly died from cancer. We put her down instead. I miss you G, you were the perfect dog and I should've loved you more. 

Moved to Northern Virginia. Went to middle school and high school here. Mom and Dad both deployed. Sister 2 got into heavy drugs. Friend went to mental institution. Another friend committed suicide by revolver. I became deeply depressed and gave up my stupid dream of being a game developer. 

Junior year. Get super into drawing. Find Mark Crilley on YouTube. Draw everyday. Fill up sketchbooks with depressing art and sexy anime babes. Realize I don't have what it takes to be an artist after years of little progress. Give up.

Graduate HS with advanced diploma. Go to community college and work at McDonald's part-time. Complete math and drop out of English due to conflicts between me and professor. Quit McDonalds after 3 weeks.

Spend 14-18 hours a day on YouTube. Hardly eat. Spend most time in bed. Masturbate profusely. Realize I'm on a fast train to nowhere. Try to join Air Force, fail 2 specialty tests and am told I will wait 6 months to ship and I'll get my job after BMT. Fuck that.

Enlist in army with bonus. Try to weasel out of it because I am a weak pathetic insect. Somehow pass. Get to job training. Like job. Pass #4 in class. Get to real army. Sucks terribly.

Go to behavioral health because I think about suicide constantly, don't clean room, rarely eat, don't sleep. Get fed some B's and given pills that didn't do anything for me. Try another psychologist. Same deal. 

Become dead inside and focus solely on job. Fast tracked on promotions. Waivered to E4. Graduated 17 out of 162 at NCO academy. Be on color guard.

I still fucking hate this lonely empty existence. I probably die from cancer anyways, 3/4 grandparents had it. Never felt loved, accepted, or had deep close relationships.

It feels like society just doesn't want me around anymore and unemployment is their way of telling me that I am not of sufficient (or any) value to them.

122374,"I want to stop existing, but maybe come back.I feel like I want to die really badly maybe every other week. I know when I wake up after a particularly bad day, it’ll be bearable again to live. Not great. Just bearable. About as often as I want to die, I’ll have a really great day and be motivated to live for a bit until I wake up the next day. I wish there was a free trial to being dead, just to make sure it’s a good route. I can cancel my death subscription if it really ruins the lives of those around me too much, because I think I keep going for them anyway.

They did have a little thing that lasted like a month but the girl wasn’t ready for a relationship so she ended it. 

I just, I feel like everyone is getting closer together, cause I also know they have group chats together with all of them in that I’m not. Like they send screenshots of random things and I can see the gc’s sometimes. Idk if they’re active and I’m just overthinking it all but, the feeling is still there and it’s just, it’s torture man.

Like, the girl that broke up with the other person, I just, I feel this sorta like, attraction to her, and idk why but I just, I wanna be liked by her yk, like I wanna be close. So I’m just stuck in thsi loop of like, I don’t wanna follow er everywhere and do everything she does, and I don’t wanna smother her ig, but I’m also just scared of losing what I’ve gained and her just leaving me behind.

I feel like an asshole cause, I’m like, picking and choosing, ig. Like idfk why I want the girl to like me, I dotn wanna go out with her or anything, Ik it would never work, but I still just, I wanna be friends but, idfk. We’ve had a Rocky relationship in the past, which was pretty much me just fucking up and her not liking me, but I think I’ve fixed that and improved. I’ve asked someone else in the group multiple times if she does actually like me, and I’m told she does but, idi just, wanna be good friends with her, and when I see her fuckin, doing shit with other people and being close to them, leaving me out, I just feel like shit.

But then I also hate myself cause of it cause it just I feel like im being an asshole about it, like an overprotective bf or soemthing. I like, ok I’ll give an example. We were all on a mc server a couple days, and it was me, her, the guy she was going out with but is now just good friends with, and a guy we all met a couple days ago. She said she only hugs her besties in game, to whcih she proceeded to hug everyone but me. We do bully each other and take the piss all the time, so idk if she was just doing it for fun, like leaving me out I mean, or if she actually meant it, cause she’s done similar things to that in the past.

It's not worth the enhanced memory, intellect, or intuition that everyone keeps telling me I have. You become a fucking walking computer obssessed with details, facts, trivialities, and other meaningless bullshit. You don't have the mental faculties to understand social cues. You might come across as creepy or weird to everyone you meet without realizing, no matter how well-versed socially you are and how hard you try.

My manager told me that a few customers were uncomfortable with how I approached them at work because ""I was too friendly."" She was kind and understanding to me about it, but I still felt like shit. How friendly is too friendly? I never asked personal questions, cracked jokes or made remarks with them.

I wish I was legitimately retarded. As in, helmet-wearing, crayon-eating retarded. I wouldn't have to function in society and maybe I wouldn't feel like killing myself. People would feel sorry for me and move on, instead of fucking trying to talk to me like they always do, and mocking me when I try to communicate with them.

I'm defective. I was never meant for this world. I'm fucking sick of having to breathe, having to wake up, having to eat. Having to pray that no one tries to talk to me in public. I've tried antidepressants and they didn't work.

269437,"Can we do this another time?I’ve been struggling for almost a year now. 
I have been my whole life really, but this has just been... different.

I have no one. I have nothing. I’ve completely isolated myself. I go long periods of time without even speaking, and I don’t really leave the house anymore. I’m just slowly deteriorating. 

Had a lot of shit pop up recently that really helped send me over the edge, and have since been begging for help - to no avail. 

Started using again. During one of my comedowns after a two week binge and its subsequent heightened state of distress, I just turned and saw the razor I used for my drugs, and before I know it I started slicing down my arm. It didn’t take much before, for whatever reason, I stopped and decided I needed to ask for help. In hysterics, with blood staining my long sleeved shirt and starting to creep down my hand and drip to the floor, I walked out of my bathroom, approached my parent, and begged for help. I was only met with, “Can we do this another time? It’s getting late.” 

Essentially being asked to reschedule my mental breakdown was really hurtful, but I tried to compromise asking when it’d be convenient for them. Annoyed, they gave me a day where they said they’d take me somewhere. I felt a little bit of relief, enough to start to gain back some composure. That day comes and I wasn’t taken because it was too inconveniencing. They had one thing to do that day, which took them about 30 minutes to accomplish, but that was evidently more important than my wellbeing. 

Since then, I’ve been trying to just make it through each day. But knowing how insignificant I am on top of everything else is making it really hard for me to even want to try anymore. 

I don’t know. 
I’m just exhausted.

I can do that just about anywhere. It scares me how easy that would be. I'm not afraid to die, I just don't want to hurt people.

If I really wanted to kill myself I wouldn't be typing this out. But still I worry that eventually I'll have an exceptionally bad day and decide that it should be my last.


REASONS TO KILL MYSELF:

-I am almost 25 years old, living with my mother. We get along very well but I'm sure at some point she will want me to be independent and move out. I feel like a burden.

-I have serious issues with anxiety that have kept me from being comfortable around people my entire life. I am deeply introverted, not shy. If I could figure out how hermits can afford food and a house I might not have any problems.

-I self-diagnosed myself with Asperger's Syndrome/Autism Spectrum Disorder (and am ashamed of being considered a faker for not having an official diagnosis). I almost cried when I realized that I possess nearly all of the traits associated with ASD. Now I understand myself in greater detail but that doesn't make life much easier.

-I have no job, no car, and I quit college because the social demands were giving me panic attacks. ""It's not what you know, but who you know."" Well I've never been good at knowing people. I would like a job, but I can't find one that doesn't give me panic attacks. All the good introvert-jobs are being replaced by machines. I've considered volunteering so that I can feel like I'm not a burden on society but I can't even muster the strength to go to school. How am I supposed to help people if I can't even breathe when I'm surrounded by strangers? 

-My one and only passion is something I can't make a living with. I make music, but the music I love is on the fringe of what people consider to be music. I like the kind of music that gets labelled ""pretentious"" or ""not music"". I couldn't write a pop song if I tried, and if I did I would hate myself. Popular music is just awful to me. There's a small niche for my kind of music, but it's very small. Unless the radio starts playing avant-garde noise, my passion is just a hobby.

-I feel like the world is very hostile to people like me. I'm not normal. Yes, I've heard every possible variation of the idea ""there's no such thing as normal"" but that's a lie. The world is more accommodating to people who are average. Money, sex, love, adventure... none of those things appeal to me. I don't like pop culture or sports so I can't really relate to anyone. My wants and desires are alien to just about everyone I meet.

-I'm weak. That's what it boils down to, I'm simply weak. The world scares me and I have no idea how to navigate it. I want to be a functioning, independent adult but every attempt I've made leaves me more depressed, anxious, and suicidal.



I guess I should see a doctor but the last thing I want to do is financially burden my mother any further. Of course, I'm sure she'd rather I not be dead.

I rely on drugs and alcohol to keep my mind off of her and the moment I have any time to myself, I just... I get sucked into thinking about her, and I can't help wanting to just... Stop living.

She was my soulmate. I felt it from the moment I met her. But she betrayed me in the worst way, cheating on me and lying to me. But even though she did that, I'm still just... Biding my time. Hoping some day she'll take me back. But she never will. Because I was too hurt and too broken to see how important she was to my happiness. 

I just want out. I want to stop feeling this way. I want to stop dreaming every single night about a girl I can't ever have again and a life that I'll never get to live. I want to stop hearing songs on the radio and thinking ""I wonder if she likes this song"" or doing something new at my job and wondering if she'd be proud of me. I want to stop seeing couples in public and being reminded of her and the guy she's with now. The guy she'll probably marry. 

I am so tired of feeling like this. I've talked to therapists and councillors and all I feel like I've gained from any of them is a general ""Yeah, dude, that blows. But it'll get better."" It's been THREE YEARS. It's not getting better. I'm getting worse. I feel sick whenever I think about her and everything makes me think about her. I would give up anything to be with her. I would do whatever it took to make her happy. But... She's already happy with someone else. So what am I supposed to do? 

Without her, I don't feel like I have any reason to live. There's no purpose in my life if it isn't to be with her and make her happy. I failed out of my college courses in nursing because I was so depressed after we broke up, and now I'm majoring in a degree I barely want, trying to date people I'm not really attracted to, desperately hiding the depths of my depression from my roommates and friends.

It's fucking silly. I mean... I have a loving family. I have friends. I have dated multiple people since her. So why? Why am I so fucked up? Why do I want so badly just to let go of my life because I lost one part of it? Why do I feel so empty without the one person in my life who hurt me the most?

I don't know the answers to these questions. I'm not sure I even want to. But I do want to know what the fuck I'm supposed to do. How do I let go? Or move on? And stop feeling such horrible feelings every time I imagine the happy future she gets to live, while I have to suffer through this hell? How am I supposed to repair my life and find a will and reason to life?",depression

I was taken to Merryfield hospital and spoke with a social worker and promised to show up to an intake appointment the next day. I didn't, the next night, I tried again, but my boyfriend called 9-11 and I was taken by an ambulance that time. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, and I'm sure most of you have too. I can't tell you there is a light at the end of the tunnel or that you are going to be okay. But I can now be realistic and share some facts. If you hot that point and think you are going to end it here and now please call 9-11. They aren't going to book you or hold you, they aren't going to shoot you up with sedatives. They will take you to the nearest mentally facility, talk to you about what they can do to help and what they can offer, and they will listen for as long as needed, then they will pay for a taxi for you to go home. It's much better for the alternative, and it really helped to assure me I might be like this, but I don't need to be, especially without exhausting all other options first. Friday I'm going in for intake, and I'll be prescribed anti-depressants. I'll be shown support groups I can go to for free or low-income, and I'll be able to at least TRY and get better. I don't know if I will, but I want to try. Please, please call 9-11 if you reach that point. In a few days I'll scan in some paper work I got for supper and therapy so maybe some of you guys can utilize it too. I'm really begging you, please listen, call if you need help",depression
319641,"Suicidal thoughts as a coping mechanismI feel like I've used the thought of suicide as a coping mechanism for so long that it's become an obsession.  It's the only future I can picture for myself.  I used to tell myself that I didnt have suicidal INTENTIONS, just the thoughts, just the desires.

I feel like there's a big part of me that I just turned off one day.  My family would support me through anything. I know that.  I could never do something so awful to them.  But I still want it so badly. Constantly, I am thinking about it. I just dont want to be here anymore.

Why is it so hard to trust people? I just dont expect them to say the right thing.  It feels like talking to the people I'm close to would make it worse.  I don't feel like therapy is an option.

Today I recieved a suicide message through our Facebook page. The woman claimed she had overdosed on pills and was waiting for death. All I had information wise was her name. Due to it being an emergency, I called several people in the hospital and was able to track down her real name and address and call 9/11 and hopefully get someone there to help. I have no further information and I'm pretty shaken up. I don't know what to do.

Anyway, I've been depressed and feeling slightly suicidal for a long time, even attend support groups and have one to one sessions but still feel down.  I'm about to turn 35 still stay with my parents and hate it.  I did manage to get myself a start in a job, starting this week but it's not really a dream or job that I would've taken normally, just doing it to get off benefits.  I find myself often getting annoyed by how my parents do things, probably just small unimportant things but annoy me just the same and this is another reason for me wanting to get away from it all.  Just an hour ago I was all set, I had a Toaster, a sink full of water and a basin with my feet in it, thinking that was make it easier to conduct the electricity.  I stood for a good 20 minutes thinking things over and then I pulled the tab on the Toaster to turn it on.  I was about to go push it the sink and then I just chickened out, turned the toaster off, emptied the sink and basin and just went back up to my room and decided to turn to here.

I don't know what to do.  I start this job on Monday, don't get my first pay till end of April and still have to stay with my parents until I can afford to move out.",depression
263527,"I suspect my college friend is planning on committing suicideI have know this guy since my 2nd ever semester of college, Spring 2017. We shared 2 classes that semester and I honestly had infatuation at first sight with him. We wound up being grouped in a class project together, where we officially met and we had instant chemistry. We would hang out on campus even if we didn't have to work on projects but, due to personal life dilemmas and a busy college schedule, I was never able to hang out with him outside of a college setting. And he never made me feel bad for it. Last time I saw him in person was the Fall 2017, 2 days before I turned 20. 

He has alluded to us being more than friends, talking about us doing wholesome, domestic and even romantic things together. He even asked my out but I couldn't go due to personal dilemmas like I mentioned earlier. Again, he never made me feel bad for taking care of my responsibilities. I was planning on asking him out the beginning of this year but, the pandemic happened, he got let go from his job &amp; he wound up moving to another state.

We occassionally text but he's been posting some concerning things. Him going to graveyards, him with huge knives, him alluding to overdosing or trying to die young. At first, I thought it was a alternative/edgy style thing, my friends, family &amp; I do stuff like photographing in graveyards and shit but once it got to the overdosing and dying young bits that really started concerning me, &amp; him holding knives didn't help. 

What skyrocketed my concern into straight up fear is, I reposted an old Halloween post of when I dressed up like The Wicked Witch of the East, the one who was squished by the house &amp; died in a ditch. My caption was, ""Felt Cute, might die in a ditch later."" He commented ""Which ditch, I'm ready right now.""

I have family &amp; friends who are suicidal, and have been for as long as I can remember. I've had to handle and support them in their low moments, but this instance might be the lowest. I already plan on trying to talk to him but I'm scared that if it escalates that I won't know how to handle it, especially since we live in seperate states and he might have a drug problem.

Do you think I'm justified in suspecting that he might be suicidal?

Am I reading too deep into things?

If it turns out to be a suicide situation, how should I handle it? 

.

TL;DR: A college friend I've know for 3 years but haven't seen in a while has been posting some concerning, suicide alluding things and I'm not entirely sure how to handle it.",depression

She does have a current bf, which I don't wanna ruin that. I'd at least she break up with him before I rlly start trying to go for a relationship. 2. She's rlly cool, (I wouldn't say trendy but maybe a little) and my parents are hard-core fucking Christians, so if they saw her insta, or what she wears on occasion they might flip and I rlly don't want to drag her through either baratement from my parents or wearing something she doesn't want to. Her parents are also divorced which they rlly would think is wack. 3. I'm a complete asshole who plays videogames. She doesn't rlly play any, which is fine that doesn't bother me, but I just know that she deserves so much better than what I have to offer. I'm not rlly the nicest person to be around(partly due to my self hatred and suicidal thoughts, which again I don't want to drag her through) and I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to being a good bf. With my last gf, it ended after a month bc we had gotten into an argument because she thought I was shunning her at school. I wasn't, I just didn't know how to act when I saw her in the halls.

I came home and tried to be normal. My kid slapped something together for me in ten minutes, I acted like it was the best thing in the world. I got one card, from my mom, that didn’t even have an envelope. My fiancé’s birthday was Monday, so we already had cake and ice cream in the kitchen left over. I went to dinner with my family and my brother was a big dramatic mess. They all went to the movies after and didn’t even invite me. It was awkward and all I could think about is how I wish I was never born. 

I know this sounds so stupid and materialistic or something. It’s been years since anyone really paid attention to my birthday, which I used to absolutely love celebrating. 

I thought it might be different today. I don’t need a lot. Really. I just wanted to feel wanted. Not leftover. 

Two weeks ago my fiancé and two best friends sat me down because he had gone through my phone and browser history. He knows I spend a lot of time lurking here. That I’m texting crisis hotlines and reading about painless ways to go. They all said they were worried about me but I feel like they made me feel worse about myself. 

I think about killing myself Every. Single. Day. Life just keeps getting harder. Every breath, every blink, every pump of blood aches my soul. I’ve been like this since I was 14 and even in the best days, I think about it. 

This is just a ramble. I can’t talk to anyone anymore, I don’t want to deal with it. I just thought maybe today would be the kind of day that I could bare through without sobbing myself to sleep in the dark. I thought the couple people I care about would get that I’m in the dark place harder than ever, after that little intervention, and maybe reach out. Call. Something.

218748,"I think I'm ready to die ?!I guess everyone though about suicide before, and I did too, but today was the first day I felt no emotion connected to it. 

I usually felt sad or overwhelmed or like everything's just 'too much'. But I've been thinking lately and I've always had this 'waiting room' vibe to my life. Studying didn't really do anything for me, it never felt like I was achieving anything or that there was a purpose to what I'm doing, it mostly annoyed me and felt like I was just passing time. I'm currently studying English and we mostly write 'research' papers on ridiculous topics like 'rap song lyrics and their deeper meaning'. I mean I get it but it seems so unnecessary and pointless to rephrase what other people said about things that could or can't be connected to the topic. 

Working part time just annoys me as well, even though I really like my coworkers and it's a nice environment. Still nothing really gets to me and it all seems like time and life's passing and I just don't belong in it. When I had these thoughts before I was mostly sad, but now I feel content about it. I've tried so many things, so many therapists, prescribed drugs and even a mental institution (after suicide attempt), but it seems a bit pointless and a waste of time. I feel like I lost myself on the way somewhere, I was a very excited and happy person once. I wanted a big family and a house with a dog and all the stupid stereotypical things. I thought about doing something about it, trying to get what I once wanted. But I would feel terrible if I'd bring a child into this, what if I'd still be this way, what if my child knew? I don't want to be selfish.

Now my BF left for university and I sat down with my laptop and suddenly it hit me, I could hang myself. And I felt nothing, I wasn't scared or sad, I was content and I felt nothing. 

I've never felt this way about it, maybe this means I'm finally ready to die? ",depression

People are telling me ""you are on a good way"" etc. etc. But...am i? im 20 years old, having problems coming to a week reflection thing with like 3 other people. Like suure im going to be a functioning member of society at like what? 30 years old?? And how should i know if i even find something i can do for over an hour at a time without literally thinking about dying.

Worst part is, im hoping to get into a bad hole again so i can actually get over myself and try the you know what again. Fuck dude back in the dark times, around 2-3 years ago i felt like shit. Im going to be honest here, it was awful. But its still bad today, even when i dont want to run infront of a train all the time. I fucking scarred myself too, stubidly at that time like ""UUH DUUH ill neever forget how shitty life was with this"" and now i got something to feel bad about everytime i look at my arm. Im kind of getting mad at me here too, right now im weak, not collected and am paranoid about what i say to not alert anyone to what i want to do. I dont know, need to rant, so ill just write what comes into me head. 

Alright. I dont have a goal, i hear what other people say to me..""Maybe a rehab is good for you beacuse this and that"" and im like YEAH hell yeah, that doctor knows what hes talking about! Lets just do that! And ofc its not what i wanted. Because i dont want anything but sit at home and do nothing. Oh woops thats not enjoyable too, who would have guessed!

Maybe i just want to do what other expect me to do, find out its not fulfilling, break down, seek help, and repeat. Looking to spend money to find something to do, and then feeling bad about spending the low amount i have. Atleast im living at home still, which soon isnt the case anymore too. I want to travel i guess, but for stupid reasons. Yeee you guessed it...:s Cant let anyone think im trying to hurt myself eh because it might have permanent repercussions.
I wouldnt say im at risk right now. But what my first (and only) attempt showed me is that i could have done it, without any feeling attatched to it. I was lying in the grass at night, just waiting like ""so whats next"". Stupid me thought like ""NOW I CAN DO WHAT I WANT HAHAHA"" felt like the king of the world and called a friend. Told him what i did, taking all these meds. And back then...i was just trying to hurt that person. I feel sick about that right now still. Like what the fuck, why would i call someone basically telling them that im going to pass in a hour or so, and just try to waste their already low battery life so they couldnt call for help. Suprise they called the police. Followed by the worst 2-3 (cant remeber) days of my life, spazzing, chained to a bed in the hospital, crying and screaming, not being able to control movement. Even after that moment i couldnt tell the docs that i didnt regret doing that one bit and that i would try again when the time comes. I feel like i just dont fit, feels like im in the wrong universe.

Basically my entire life I have spent on the computer, addicted and doing nothing at all. Now I've come out of the bubble into incredible pressure with no skills whatsoever. I feel like I'll just go broke and never be able to succeed in life at all, so why not end it soon anyway? If I can't find a job in the next few weeks I will - got nothing to lose, I have too big dreams to be a welfare guy everyday. 

I also can't stand working, never have been able to, don't understand why. Probably bad social skills but I always feel very anxious and attacked by people, every day when I've worked before I've been stressed out of my mind even if the job is relatively simple. No social skills, no ability to defend myself from others, too weak to assert myself.

I don't think anyone has ever made a comeback from a life this bad, even the addicts had tons of friends, I've got none. Computer addiction is fucking horrible and destroyed me, and soon it will all be at an end.",depression
315536,"Try to Remember, Forget...So guys, it is my birthday, it is a new year. I should be happy that I am still here. Light up a new joint, put on an old shirt; try to remember, forget how my brain works. But I could read a book a night before this year, I knew every word their definitions clear. But now in stealth I check the thesaurus - it's become my guilty mistress. So I heave my breath at burning wax because I know that spark ain't coming back. I've got all my friends here but they haven't been talking as of lately because they've all found new bro's and babies. I have smoked away my pride, there is nothing but the cinders of it inside. But I believed in more than nothingness last year and under every quiet failure it's still here. Buried breathing under 18 years of tragedy and fear. If I could crawl my way out of this grave just think of all the time I'd save. The stereo's playing the same old songs but we still hum along.
In no time we'll be spread across the earth, donning business suits to show the faceless master what we're worth. From our huggies to armani, and it all seems so rehearsed. Anyone else agree?

313626,"I'm trapped**Post I put in a thread on suicide**

I've been semi suicidal the last 2 months so fuck it throwaway venting.

I grew up poor and abused. After my situation improved when I was 12 I began trying to get out and get to a better place. I spent from 13-24 dreaming the American dream. In 12 years I had gone from under educated impoverished child to a college educated man with a wife, house, career and car.

I hate my career,
I hate my house,
and I am not fond of paying out the ass for my car just to keep the house and career.

My wife and I met at 17 and she is an intelligent and beautiful person. She is also very selfish. We opened up our relationship, a thing I still don't regret. In that time though she got caught up with other guys and neglected me. I never wanted her to be hurt so I didn't tell her that it's ok she sleeps with other guys I just needed some love too. I tried to tell her in my way but couldn't I had accepted that I had lost the love of my life to my own idiocy.

At the same time I started dating one of her friends (against the rules if I asked but her friend approached me which was ok) and we fell in love almost instantly. We both went through almost the same thing as children, we have incredible amounts of things in common. For the first time in my life someone understood me. Which in the process of making me very happy almost entirely destroyed me. The stark contrast of being understood for the first time ever with the rest of my life has left me in shambles. On top of that I told me wife I fell in love with this woman and I've been trying to work it out since.

I know I'd be happier with the new woman and so would she. I believe my wife would be happier with a man more like her. My wife is putting all of the blame on me for the situation. I am ""cheating"" as she calls it. I am the one doing all the wrong. Why is it wrong that 2 people who have felt isolated and alone found each other?

On top of everything my house is signed by the father in law. It's also worth $10,000 less than when I bought it. So I can't sell it at above a loss and I can't abandon it as it would be a terrible thing to do to my father in law.
So I am stuck with:

* A house I don't want,

* A career I have to have to keep that house,

* A car and loan to get to and from the job that just had the check engine light come on today god fucking damnit.

* A wife who is blaming me for our joint failing marriage,

* A G/F who is being torn apart by her role in all of this,

* I have debt for almost every item on this list. Debt that financial advisers told me was a wise decision, debt that I was told to take on so I could chase my dreams. Dreams that I was told would finally give me some happiness. So that one day I could fucking feel like I'm not a societal mistake, that I contribute more than I take to the world.

What do I do? I hate my life and I see no solution that doesn't cause others pain. Throw on top of all of this that I have psychological disorders I can't get help for because the waiting list is 16-20 weeks long. One of those disorders being that I have incredible empathy for loved ones. I literally feel everyone's pain in this situation. I know how much my wife's heart is breaking at losing her husband. At the same time I know my g/f heart is breaking because for the first time in her life someone has understood the rape, abuse, poverty, torture she went through and not recoiled in disgust or thought of her as ugly because of it. But that person is a married man and she is contributing to ruining a marriage 

I just want everyone I love to be happy but making any of them happy will make others unhappy. Making myself happy will cause others unhappiness that will in turn make me unhappy. Doing the same thing day in and day out is the least painful option but it's wearing me down. I cry silently at my desk many days. I wake up and arrive late to work because I fantasize about killing myself instead of living another day in this perpetual state of impossible.

We are in crunch time at work so if I don't show up and work my ass off everyday then the company may go under. So I can't even take time off.

And then it's become clear either through my abilities or understanding that no one knows how or why I am in this situation. It's incredibly clear people misunderstand me. All I want in this life is to love others and do something great. There is more standing in my way to doing that than I can handle. I need help, I can't do this but who will help me? Everyone on here will tell me to lawyer up, gym hitting etc etc. 

I'm so stuck and I hate this life. I hate this society we live in. I hate the way our government works and I hate that I understand just how screwed I am. I just want to die. I don't want to have to look at my wife with tears in her eyes as she begs me to fix this. I can't because part of the problem is things she has to deal with but won't because she is blaming it on g/f existing and not on her neglect. I hate this and just want to kill myself. It will hurt others but not as much as others are hurting me.

I am afraid that without help my willingness to endure will be seriously compromised. I have already seriously considered it on 2 instances. I also attempted suicide at 11 and failed. I know I'm capable of doing it and this time I'm afraid I'm much smarter than 11 year old me and won't fail.",depression

I numb the pain with alcohol, gambling and video games. My sleep patterns are inverted. All I see is darkness, literally. No passions left, no interests nothing left but painful memories... I've entirely detached myself from society too. We have nothing in common any more. It's not your fault it's not my fault it's just how it is.. I simply do not fit in any more. I've nothing left but hate and resentment in my heart. I truly hate this world with every ounce of my being. At this stage as sick as it sounds I can only find comfort in others' suffering. I want to see others suffer just like I have as it's all I can relate to. I read the news hoping to find something more tragic than my own life. Years of good intentions never got me anywhere in this fucked up world. It's really not hard to understand why I am like this.

200903,"I don't feel like I DESERVE to be aliveHopefully some of you can relate. I don't know if anyone even cares enough to read this, but I'm on my last leg today. 

Ever since I can remember, I've felt like it was in my cards to kill myself. Growing up, I was fat, ugly, and had an issue with excessive crying, bursting out into tears in class since I was in preschool. It never went away. I would have to be removed from elementary school constantly because I would just BURST out crying. Just always fantasizing about death and how I didn't deserve to be alive. My dad was pretty mean and hit me sometimes, but it was mostly yelling and swearing at me, never rape or anything ridiculously bad. 

When he hit me, I felt like I deserved it, because I was a ""bad"" kid for always crying in school and freaking out. Turns out the freaking out and crying was because I had OCD as an actual child, which is fairly rare. If I couldn't count in order or if I had an intrusive thought about contamination or God smiting me, I would cry. Had this occurred in adulthood, maybe I could have handled it with more grace, but when you're 7 and you ""hear God tell you in your head that you have tapeworms,"" what are you supposed to do but have a panic attack?

My parents refused treatment for me because they said ""I would grow out of it."" This ostracized me at school to the point of other girls and boys calling me ""psycho."" I would wash my hands in the bathroom for 35 minutes and get in trouble for it, then get dragged back into the middle school classroom, crying. And, obviously, middle school girls + weird girl with bleeding hands= extreme bullying for me. 

This identity has never left me. I now feel like the crazy girl, and I eventually believed them when they said I should kill myself. I still feel like I am a freak. I used to do the whole shebang, the twitching face, the opening and closing the classroom door... I was a fucking freak and I would have been freaked out, too. My whole childhood, gone. I never had a childhood. I'm only going to live once, so now that the best years of my life are nothing, why keep living?

I never had a single friend growing up. Not one. My only friend was food, or my mom. This is pathetic. I would take it out on my mom (telling her I wished she was dead, calling her horrific swears, saying I wished I was aborted, threatening to kill myself to make her afraid as a kid). I didn't KNOW why I was so pissed at her... but in retrospect, I guess I was pissed because she would not help me... she just kept me her helpless, psychotic baby who still needed reassurance and help getting dressed in the morning. A part of me thinks she liked it... I was so mentally ill in 7th grade, I was afraid to touch my clothes because of ""germs on them."" My mother had to dress me when I was 12 years old. Still, no therapy allowed. Every day felt like fucking war. I lost 20 lbs from anxiety, I was too afraid to eat because I thought ""there were aliens in my food."" OCD as a kid SUCKS, because you don't have a great grip on reality to begin with...

This hurts me and keeps me up at night to this day, because my mother is actually the sweetest person alive. She NEVER hurt me, she just prevented me from getting treatment because she lives in complete denial of anything threatening. She even pretends my sister isn't gay because she thinks she can will things away. I feel bad for her cause I wonder if it is MY fault she became this way. Maybe if she didn't have a psycho cunt daughter with OCD who told her she hated her everyday, she wouldn't have turned to denial so often. What if I made HER crazy, too? I feel like a curse, and my dad called me that a lot as a kid, he also called me a fat cunt, etc. He told me ""he tried to motivate me.""

That clearly didn't work for my depression, because I'm still here, alone on a Friday night, posting to Reddit for help that I probably won't get. People will probably skim this, say TLDR, and move on. Because I'm fucking worthless. And I know it. You guys don't actually care about me.

I am here tonight because I feel like there is literally no hope for me. I have tried therapy, meds, etc. I am now 23 years old. I just graduated college. I made NO FRIENDS in college, because my OCD resurfaced in the form of a severe eating disorder. I lost 100 lbs and ended up 68 lbs at age 19. I almost died, and nobody at my school wanted to be seen with me because I was so disgusting and thin (the cruel irony when I grew up fat). Still, I got a 4.0 in college. I moved out at age 20 and got a job in a really cool place. I landed a near impossible job. I don't want to get into the specifics for confidentiality purposes, but I work at a studio as a filmmaker. 

When I tell people my life story, they judge me. Nobody ever looked at me the same after I made my college thesis film about having depression. I have several people in my alumni association telling everyone ""she's crazy."" It does more than hurt my feelings, it makes me want to fucking kill myself. I finally got this dream job, and here these assholes in the alumni association are, ruining my chance to start fresh and excel. I never hurt anyone. All I did was have a mental illness. And yet they want to ruin me. I don't feel like I can succeed at my new job now, since some of the alumni work at the same studio. If I am such a burden to my mom and dad, if I can't control my weight or eating now, why am I alive? ",depression

46657,"Told my family about my three suicide attemptsTbh I don’t know why I’m writing this but here I go.

 I’m from Kosovo and these things just don’t “exist” there, and if you actually express your feelings of sadness and depression you won’t be taken serious and be called lazy or an attention seeker. Recently about 8 months ago I’ve come clean to my family and told them about my depression and my three suicide attempts. I’m always 100% hones with people and hate lying or being around the bush, my parents are not the best, we moved to another country and opened a bakery. Ever since they’ve neglected me and never paid any kind of attention to anything I was saying or doing. My depression started that year when we moved here to Croatia and I had to leave everything behind and start over with new people, a new school, whiteout knowing the language or anything about the culture. I started to sleep all day, not talk to anyone, draw dark stuff, listen to depressed songs. I used to stay in my room all the time, the longest being 2 weeks without going out when I was on my school spring break. My dad yells all the time, my mom does everything she’s told to do, typical Albanian married couple, my older sister was always busy  taking care of the “business” and my younger brother was always and still is a dickhead. It’s been 9years since I became depressed and throughout those years I’ve attempted to end it all 3 times, now that I’ve been asked why I’m always so negative, angry, why I’m always so rude towards my parents I told them they’re shit at their job of parenting and I got shut down real quick by them telling me I’m just and attention seekers, lazy and always selfish, even after I told  them about the 3 attempts. They didn’t do anything. But today i told my mom as a joke that I cut my hair yesterday when I took a shower and my brother joked and said “should have cut your wrists instead”, I got really pissed and started yelling at him and my mom and sister started yelling back at me saying something along the line of “your taking this way to far, you need to collect yourself” ... Sooo I just wanted to ask if I’m the only one in this kind of situation or is there anybody else. Because I just cursed out God and really don’t see anything worth living this life for but I’m also not going to kill myself because basically I’m a wuss so I’ll just continue to cry, isolate and slowly kill myself with stress until all the left hair falls out and I become obese.",depression

I'm tired of living in this shit little game. I used to make art and feel love and emotion but Ive given up all of my passions for the last 3 years so I could work to live.

The only info I know is that the fire started upstairs. So, me and my family have been airbnb and hotel hopping for a little bit. Now that we've got the context out of the way, I'd like to say why exactly I wanna die. There's a lot of reasons. I'll bore people saying them all, so I'll only say the big ones. 

Me and my partner of almost 3 years had to break up with each other, because we did something we shouldn't have. We wore forbidden to speak to each other for a while, but we disobeyed, feeling that the punishment was unfit for the stupid thing we did. Now, we are unable to contact each other in any form, most likely forever.

As I said previously, my house pretty much burned down. Most everything was water damaged or smoke damaged from the water the firemen used to put out the fire (little did I know, that shit's poisonous, cuz of chemistry and shit). Our cookbooks, any art on the walls, our beds, our documents.. anything that wasn't perfectly safe was either damaged, or garunteed gone.

Both of my cats are dead, one from old age, and the other from a tumor, and internal bleeding.

As hard as I try, I still can't completely recover from my childhood trauma involving my school. It haunts me, triggering me in ways that seem like huge symptoms of CPTSD. 

I grew up in a shitty neighborhood that people think is great from the outside, not knowing that it's not all rainbows and sunshine.

I still have to deal with my transphobic mom, who still doesn't fully accept me after I began to transition almost a year ago.

I have no friends here, and no nearby family aside from my parents where I live. All my friends, family, and pretty much my life are back in Cali.

The only way I can feel any emotion (aside from emptyness) now is either when I hear my parents arguing or fighting, or when I'm listening to music. 

I feel like no one takes my problems seriously, I feel extremely lonely. I feel that no one would really put in the effort to stop me before things get worse, before I finally kill myself. If I do, it will be fucking beautiful. 

I find beauty in the wrong things, happiness in places that aren't correct. I feel like a fractured piece of glass, but at the same time it feels like nothingness or maybe my position in hell as a demon would suit me better.

The world is fucked.
But, everyone already knows that.

What no one seems to notice is that people sometimes need a fuck ton more help than they seem to. They try once, and then give up if it doesn't work. 

""Well, I tried.""

Enough of that rambling though, I guess.


I am constantly considering offing myself when I feel crushed, when I feel emotions again. I always need someone to scream to, to cry on their shoulder, to vent nonsense words to, and have them still care about me at all, to still have them not be freaked out by the thoughts I spit out.

I don't trust people anymore. I still look over my shoulder. I still freeze up or tremble when I hear anything resembling gunshots. I can't speak, I go mute when adults yell or shout at each other or at kids. 



I'm a Kedamono.
I'm a Akuma.

I call myself these things not because I really belive I physically am these things, but I call myself them because I associate myself with the terrible nature that they are commonly made up to be. I hate myself that much.

91557,"Is it normal to have parents who don't respect the normal behaviour of a teen? I'm now 17, and my parents are still constantly on my back for the most stupid things. Below are just a few rules that seem to pop up quite frequently.

* Can't have my door closed when doing homework
* No earphones when doing homework or just pretty much in general and my device volume has to be 100
* Talking with friends online (voice chatting with irl friends that they know) for more than a couple minutes is a waste of my time
* Talking back to my dad in English (he's Chinese with limited English speaking skills and I was born in English speaking country) automatically translates to me agreeing with him which is frustrating because if i try to say it in Chinese it gets misunderstood and he starts picking on that
* Can't stay up past 11:30 even on weekends, my devices get taken away at night too

My main issue is that these rules seem to pop up at the most random times. I'll be chatting with some mates, then my dad will open the door and order me to unplug my earphones. If I ask why then he'll start layering more and more rules. The occasional time he tries to add reasoning he just spews what I believe to be bullshit about everything being done for my sake and my future and that all parents are like this blah blah you know what I mean. My mum also just tends to pretend it doesn't happen and just tells me to not hold grudges against him. He also doesn't listen when I try to explain myself and takes it as a chance to make me look more like the bad person ;-;

I'm definitely not saying that I have it bad, because compared to some of the things I've seen people go through and apart from these little issues, my life is relatively decent. I'm lucky to have supportive friends and a financially stable family so please don't take this as me just being an ungrateful whiny child.

321118,"Today is my 19th Birthday. Will I make it to 20?Ive been off my medication for 2 months now? 3 ? I’m not really sure. Since I finished school and my exams, I’ve felt better but I think the buzz of not being classed as a kid anymore has worn off and I’m not settling into the idea of living the rest of my life. This is something that has been on my mind for a year or two now. The problem now is that it’s real, I’m coming to terms with the fact that I’m not a kid anymore, and  I understand there is bigger problems in the world than this. I am thinking of myself here, my mental health and my situation. 

I’ve always thought with a positive mindset , 
“Think of your parents, your family, of everyone that will miss you when you’re gone” 
Would my parents know why I killed myself if I went through with it? I’m not sure, to be honest I can’t even pinpoint where it all started going wrong. 

Around Transition Year (4th year), I found things rough, I did have friends and I still have them friends thankfully but I always felt like the outsider, the person they wouldn’t notice if I wasn’t there, the person who would be forced to walk behind the group cause there wasn’t enough space, that sort of thing. Anyways Transition Year (TY for short) was my first experience into life outside of school and in a work place, I didn’t get paid but I worked same hours as my co-workers and gained “experience”, the only thing I gained from TY was I found out I hate a lot of things. 

I despise talking to people, making conversation, being fake happy, I would rather sit on my own in my room and watch Netflix all day than spend time conversing with people about topics I have no interest in. 

I’ve just realized I am just using this as a way to vent about my feelings and avoid my family that are downstairs. I’ve also got sidetracked so I’ll get back to the point. 

I am, as of today, nineteen years old and I simply do not want to make it to twenty, I know I’m gonna die this year, I’ve seen it in my dreams and I find myself subconsciously saying it everyday. I don’t know when, where or how yet, I don’t know if I wanna find out. Does anyone know why I am thinking I will die this year, is it some form of indication or is it just nonsense ?
Either way it has made me think and if I was to die this year, would it be all that bad ? I don’t know. 

I don’t think I got my message across properly, I don’t know what message I was trying to say but no one will ever know what’s going on inside my head and I’ll never know what’s going on inside someone else’s. Maybe I’m just at a low point in life or maybe I’m right to think this way. I don’t know if this is the right sub reddit to be posting this on, Ive never done this before.",depression

I tried to see if I could make myself happy by making other people happy, so I started a youtube channel. I started writing and drawing for people.

I tried to push through each day even when I was unhappy, but nobody cares. If I were gone, nothing would change. Nothing would fucking change. Everybody would love on like it was normal because I have no effect on anybody's life. I can't even make a ripple into anybody's life.

But today I was home alone, doing the washing up and I noticed my SO had taken a small knife out of the lock box last night to prepare dinner but had forgotten to put it back. I didn't want to hurt myself but I found myself pressing the knife against my wrist and sawing it. Luckily the knife wasn't as sharp as I imagined so it wouldn't break the skin. It made me feel sick for a bit and I pulled myself away, dropped it and went into the other room. I rang my SO but she didn't pick up. I left a message. For some reason after I hung up I stood back up and went back to the sink, picked up the knife and started sawing again, though I didn't want to. I tried several times to slice open my wrist, i put as much pressure into it as i could and eventually, by angling the blade I managed to draw a small amount of blood. It made me feel good. Powerful, though that feeling of sickness was still there. At that point my SO phoned me. 

She's since come home and when she saw the marks on my wrist she was angry and scared. Now neither of us know what to do.

270121,"Ruined my own lifeMost of my childhood I was unhappy, but never really processed how bad the situation was until I was 10. Before age 10, whenever I was frustrated I would cry. Which was a lot. 

My father would always call me a ""faker"" when I'd cry because I 'smile' when I cry. Completely would invalidate any feelings I actually had along with my mother.

It wasn't until age 10 that I started acknowledging my parents were indeed shitty. 

Description of my father:
1st he never actually wanted to be a Father. He's flat out stated to me that he wishes I had been aborted. (Me too, buddy)
Very absent as a father, despite having lived in the same house together my entire life.
Thinks that he's amazing, and that everyone else is beneath him. Has strong philosophical/and political views. Forces said opinions on others. Big hothead. Thinks he's right about every topic ever. 

Description of my mother:
Claims to be this positive, nice, wholesome person. Constantly involving herself in drama. Gossiping. Quick tempered. Belittles everything. Always points out flaws of others; excludes self of any wrongdoings. 

It's hard to know which one really fucked me up worse. I honestly hold a lot of resentment and don't know what to do. There are a lot of things they've said and done to me that I feel are unforgivable, and they have no remorse anyways.  They view me as the problem. They think their actions are ok. 

Can never just have a conversation with my mom. If I somehow upset her even by just disagreeing with something, I'm ""crazy"", and she goes off on me. If I  do something wrong even accidently,  she'll always bring it up and remind me. But if she does something wrong, I need to ""get over it"". 
Something about her, is that she has always  had a very bad memory. She never remembers things, and always gets things wrong. Everyone that knows her, is aware of this. The problem with this is that she is always so CERTAIN that she remembered things right. She basically creates her own memories. This is for even basic everyday things. Ex: She'll think something is on sale, it is not, then she insists it is. Makes a big scene, and flips out on me. Now for other situations it's very annoying. I can't say for sure that she's flat out lying, but at times it does appear that way. For example if her and I are 'arguing' she'll tell it all to my father and she'll add things that never happened/ never were said. Doesn't even explain what originally happened. Makes me sound horrible and portrays herself as a victim. 

My father would automatically take her side without even allowing me a chance to explain what happened. I'd get screamed at for things I never did/said. Me denying those things would have him brand me a liar. He'd call me every name in the book. Every. Single. Name. Constantly threatened to hit me, and would legit swing at me at times. It was rare that he *actually* hit me, but he always brought that tension. He was filled with rage. He has broken countless objects in my room over nothing.  (This happened mostly from ages 10-16) I would often attempt to defend myself during these ages. I'd tire myself out, stress myself out by trying to keep up with him and tell him that he's a terrible father, and that what my mother and I argue about  has nothing to do with him. Looking back wasn't a good idea to even acknowledge him, because there's no getting through to him. 

This kind of thing happened so often, pretty much daily during those times. Mainly revolved around school. My mom hated driving me to school. Everyday to wake me up she'd literally come in and legit kick my head. (I slept on my bedroom floor at this time) She'd always already be in a bad mood to wake me up everyday. ""Wake up dumbass"". Never a simple ""Time for school"" or ""Good morning"". I'm actually a light sleeper so you could literally just say my name once and I'd wake up.  

At age 13 I became actually depressed. This is a really heavy topic, but I legit remember my 1st time contemplating suicide. 
I completely hated myself just as much as my parents hated me, if not more. 

I lost all motivation. I really hated going to school. I didn't see a future for myself anymore. I started skipping it as much as possible, which in turn only made my homelife situation worse. It wasn't because my parents cared, it was because ""your loser ass isn't going to make us go to jail"". So in a way I am partly responsible for why things got more intense. I would downright refuse to go at times and an officer would come pick me up, forcing me to go. I never made a fuss to authority btw. I listened right away and was polite. 

I remember once I was not wanting to go to school and my father was screaming at me and I'll never forget he said, ""I can't wait until I can stomp on your head in hell."" and my father dragged me by my hair from my bedroom, all through the hallway, to the front door. 
Another time he poured an entire bucket of what I can best describe as ""sewage"" water onto my head. (Basically our sink is messed up and leaks out this horrid brown and black liquid that smells absolutely disgusting) 

At age 16 early September, after a particularly bad fight, my father threatened to kick me out if I got into another argument with either him or my mother. In this fight he told me I'm a failure and that I should drop out of school because I'll fail anyways. Well, even though I wanted out of this house so badly I had/have nowhere else to go. That seemed so scary. I decided I wouldn't ever talk to them again. I never officially dropped out, I just never went back. That was in 2014. I've never spoken to my father ever since. I didn't talk to my mother either for 4 months. Eventually I did talk to her and just completely sucked up to her essentially. I would blindly agree with her on anything she said, and do what she wanted me to. I was so lonely. I did that so I could at least go places (just stores...) 

Time passes and things only got worse. In 2016 in July (my birth month) I got a really bad infection in my arm. I didn't know it was an intection neccesarily at the time, since I've never had any issues like that. All I knew was that my arm was completly red and had an intense tightening feeling.  After a couple of days, it got increasingly worse. I remember showing it to my mom. Days passed.  On my literal 18th birthday I couldn't move my arm. Finally my mother decided to bring me to an urgent care center. Funnily enough, they actually rejected me because I didn't have an ID...on my 18th birthday. Went to another place and the guy prescribed me antibiotics sent me on my way. Thought all was merry.  Like 2 days afterwards it spread even further up my arm, right up to my shoulder. My skin looked so nasty and was incredibly painful. I asked my mom to make a doctor's appointment. She said she would. Later this day, she ended up yelling at me over leaving the garage door open. (It was an accident) She turned it into a fight and said ""You know what? You can deal with that!"" 'That' meaning my arm. I remember just going in my room and sobbing. 

The only person I have to thank is my brother. He's a year older than me. He is normally really quiet, and just goes with what they say. This is the 1st time he publically defended me. He said I need to see a doctor. I feared he would get yelled at too, but she actually listened to him.
Went to the family doctor. He suspected it was a brown recluse bite and said I needed to go to the hospital. Never have been to a hospital in my life btw. Ended up being in the hospital for 4 days. During that time at one point my mom yelled at me, at the fucking hospital, and left me there alone. My brother visited and stayed the night twice. No one else visited me. 

Somehow I still tried to suck up to my mom after this. It wasn't until an entire year later (July 2017) on my birthday-again! That was when my mom said really fucked up things to me that made me realize I really can't deal with her. She also laughed at my 1st panic attack I'd ever had. I haven't talked to her since. It's very interesting/unique how I live in this house but don't speak with either of my parents. Nobody knows this outside of this house.
Even my older half siblings have no idea. Obviously, I'm not close with them at all...

Anyways, at this point I'm 19 years old, birthday is in 4 months. I have nothing to my name. I don't even have an ID made, can't drive, no job, dropout. I've never been to a party, never had a boyfriend, hell never even had my first kiss. I have nothing going for me in life. I am the biggest failure to exist. I don't have a way to get out of this house. I'm stuck here. I actually haven't left my house at all since October. I don't want to live like this, and it's not possible to change my life. Meaning there isn't a chance for things to ""get better"". They'll only get worse.  

I do realize and accept that not everything is my parents fault btw. Ultimately I decided to not go to school, I was too weak and stupid to stay in school. I let them affect me, etc;
Even though I feel that they caused me a lot of pain, I don't blame them entirely for my problems. Nonetheless, I'm so unhappy and miserable.
I've decided that I need to die.  I've always contemplated it, daydreamed even, but never really acted on it. I only attempted once in 2016,  and it was a mediocre attempt tbh. I'm truly ready now. I actually feel relieved already? Just knowing it'll all be over soon.

278344,"Abused as a child - I think it screwed me up..Help?This is going to be long and all over the place, but I just needed a safe space to be able to get this out.

I was raised in a very abusive family environment, and I'm worried that it's damaged me irreparably. My parents were very religious and involved with the catholic church, often they would use religion as a platform for the heinous acts they'd force upon my siblings and I.
I won't go into detail of the abuse itself, but suffice to say that for all of my childhood I was belittled, humiliated, harshly beaten, severely punished at every opportunity and sexually assaulted by several family members. To this day the residual effects of that abuse manifests in PTSD, depression, self harm, fear of abandonment and hyper-sexual tendencies, which I've been coping with since I was about five years old.

The worst part being that because I was raised this way, I didn't understand the gravity of what I was living through until after I'd finally left. The abuse was so constant and we were kept so completely socially isolated that it was normalized and accepted as just a part of every day life.
One night when I was 15, I'd finally had enough and ran off, I've been on my own ever since.

I'm in my early 20's now and it's been a long road to recovery, I know that I'm still healing. But I've been disturbed to realize that aspects of my sexuality have been influenced by my childhood traumas and I can't help feeing betrayed by my own mind and body, and sometimes it just makes me feel sick to acknowledge it.

I'm been coming to terms with the reality that I'm a sexual sadist, meaning I derive sexual pleasure and satisfaction from the pain or humiliation of others. However, I don’t think of it as just enjoying seeing other people suffer- what I enjoy is when people consent for me to hurt them, either emotionally or physically (or often both).

While I have very limited experience in this as it's difficult for me to open up to others about this aspect of my life, for me it comes down to two aspects – control and connection. I very much enjoy being in control of another person, having both the ability to bring them pleasure and pain, and to manipulate their emotions, hopefully fulfilling fantasies of their own along the way, is intoxicating. In terms of connectivity, the trust that people place in me to hurt them is a very gratifying and secure feeling for me.

I'm so grateful that with the help of a therapist, I've become decent at compartmentalizing my sexual urges and my personal morality. Having been experiencing extreme sexual fantasies from a very young age without any understanding of what it meant, it helped when I first started learning about sadism and kink on the internet, though I never thought I’d consider – for example, degrading women as objects for male pleasure, engaging in gendered emotional sadism, forceful sex acts or to simulate abusive relationships. My fantasies of whipping a woman or forcing her to degrade herself while she cried upset me just as much as aroused me, and for a very long time left me emotionally confused and exhausted.

All of my life I swore that I would not grow up to be like my parents, and for the most part I've been successful. I'm able to control my anger, I find great joy in taking care of others, and I never lash out irrationally. But even so, the sexual trauma still left enough of an imprint on my developing psyche that my sexuality was forever influenced by their selfishness and evil acts.
While I’ve learned that participating in kink in a contained environment within a safe and consensual dynamic doesn’t challenge my ideals...On the other side of that coin, sadism is also part of the unhealthy and dark side of life, not the healthy and bright side of it. Being sadistic is not being nurturing, but destructive, it breaks the stability of society and isn't appropriate for a family environment. It would destroy me to know that a sadist was hurting my loved one, so how can I possibly put someone else in that same position?

I struggle with these feelings a lot as I'm generally peace-loving and do my best to be kind and considerate of others..and yet I can't shake these primal urges to consensually own, use and abuse another person.
Am I a monster? Am I evil? Is there a place in this world for someone like me? I don't even know.

I should mention that despite my attraction to abusive behaviors on a sexual level, I'm not at all that way in my personal life. I believe that no one is ""better"" than anyone else and we should all have equal opportunity to succeed in life. There should be fair treatment of all people, regardless of gender, race or creed and I'm an ally for social causes, particularly to areas where there is considered to be inequality and try to help rectify these issues if I can. 

I'm reaching a point in my life where because of my history and it's effect on me, I'm feeling completely alone and overwhelmed. I've lived with this secret shame so long, and for the life of me I don't know what to do with it.
 If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read about my screwed up life. If you have advice, incite or your own story to share that would be very welcome and appreciated.
I hope this finds you all safe, healthy and happy.

Turns out, It was the biggest mistake of my life. For 9 months i was stuck in a house unable to leave for 8 hours a day. when i could leave, it was dark and the local businesses wouldn't allow a minor in, so there was basically nothing to do.

 I never made a friend while there, i never saved any money because my boss fucked me over, i didnt get to do a single fun activity in one of the most ""exciting"" cities in the US, I was stuck in a house with minimal human contact for 9 months. I even tried to kill myself on my birthday after I didnt get one call or text from anyone. I spent my birthday crying and alone. But I kept telling myself ""it'll all be worth it when you get home"" and ""all your friends are waiting for you, it'll be great when i get home."" And i even had a female friend i had been texting while away that i thought things might get more serious with. things were genuinely looking good when i got back.

 So my 9 months in hell ends. i come home so excited for change, and everything is worse.

292126,"Read if you want...This isn't a cry for help, or a plea, an attempt at attention, or even a final note to the world (I hope)...

We are far beyond that at this point.

My name is Samuel, born on the 26th day of April, 1991.

When I was 14, I noticed that I didn't perceive, nor experience things in the same ways as other teenagers, or adults for that matter. Because of this, throughout my foray into adulthood and beyond, I have always been the easy person to single out; at the same time, I have also learned how to be the chameleon that no one notices.

One of my friends put it simply: I have the mental and genetic makeup to be a nightmarish serial killer, yet somehow there was a step that was cut short... some action or event that should have occurred, but didn't, leaving the circuit open, so to speak.

I find this both depressing and funny. Truth be told, one of my personal favorite quotes, ""Life is a joke, albeit, a bad joke, but a joke nontheless; learn to roll with the punchlines,"" has become the guideline to my life. I thought...

Back to 14.

Being ostracized, told you're different, being made fun of, beaten, bruised, thrown down stairwells, framed, laughed at... it's all good for character. It shows you what you are truly made of. Tests your mettle. Sends your soul through the crucible.

To be honest, it isn't the external inputs that most people should be fearful of. No, the most dangerous enemy any one person faces, the monster, the quiet, creeping, seething creature that is the true threat to your existence, at all times, is your own mind.

I have been at war with myself ever since I entered ""civilization.""

And, let's face it, it sucks. It really does. People are idiots, the mob, senseless, writhing, never accounting for personal actions of the self, always criticizing the actions of others. There exists a mirror for a reason. That reflection should always be the loudest voice in your mind, pounding, reverberating, coursing through the cracks in the glass.

For most, this might be a good thing. Mine might actually succeed in killing me.

(No, this message isn't concise and laid out clearly, which should speak volumes about the person who is writing this.)

Here's a joke: what happens when you take a (probably) slightly psychopathic, introverted, not-clinically depressed kid, who has been sheltered by his parents his entire life, told that there is a certain way to think, home-schooled and kept out of the system, he will always be special, and that life must have an amazing plan for him?

You set his mind up to be hit by the biggest scorched earth policy since the United States dropped Agent Orange and napalm in Vietnam.

Every. Single. Element.

For most individuals, you go out into the world, you find friends, you find love, you communicate freely and you meet people and network, and there is absolutely no shred of effort in this. This isn't a bad thing. It's great! People should absolutely be able to do these things, and exercise their minds in these areas.

Me... mine was different. Survived high school, and all the days that I would come home and wonder, ""what really dramatic and extra ways can I think of to make my death legendary?"" I'd make Shakespeare cry.

Funny how most of the kids in my school thought I would be the next school shooter, even though the only thoughts of harm that ever came to me was either killing myself, or finding a way to burn the school down, with no one in it. I never intended to harm any of them. Strange... now that I think about it. Sure, many of them probably deserved to have their nails ripped out by pliers, but giving them something as extreme as death was never really an option... maim maybe, or slightly injure, scare.

But... according to the United States Department of Justice, none of these events ever happened.

All I really learned, because school itself was a fucking joke and I passed everything without even really studying (I wrote a 2,000 word essay in 15 minutes because it was the last day of turn in), was that I couldn't really trust people, I couldn't depend on hardly anyone for anything, and the only band of friends I had kept me around because of my math skills whenever they were dealing pills.

I wish I could say things changed in college.

The depression, like a lurking nightmare in the darkness, didn't go away. It just found a more tactically advantageous position to terrorize me from.

Same bullshit, different story. Roommate was a drug dealer, he was in with all the cool kids, always was able to find a woman whenever he wanted to, and I was the nerdy, pasty weirdo who was quiet all the time, had no self esteem, zero charisma, and was quickly finding out that the Department of Defense scholarship I got for my mechanical engineering degree was probably going to go to waste.

There is one positive about this. I got a front row seat to how effective proper networking is. I also discovered Mary Jane. Fun times... the only time I feel like I was able to have an actual conversation with the horror in my mind instead of just having to beat it back with a stick.

Of course all ""good"" things must come to an end, and at the end of a second semester at the Polytechnic campus, I was a D student, and I was just sick of it all. The only difference between college and high school was that the teachers were more liberal, the kids were turning into adults, drugs were like candy, and I was incredulously behind on the social learning curve. Also, flunking out of college after telling yourself for the last five years that this was the path you had to take, kind of kits you in the humility and ego department.

I began to just tell myself that I was stupid, worthless... a worm that crawled through the trenches of the earth, only to rise and be picked off by the infinitely more successful birds of the air.

So, that's a fairly indecent view of my mind, right?

Oh wait, there is so much more.

After my crash and burn in college, I came back home, lived in my parent's basement, and found that all the motivation and inspiration that existed in my life was dead, completely. My mother, of course, saw this as an excellent opportunity to get some work out of her son, and got me to repair half the issues with the house we lived in at the time (365 S. Third St, Globe, Arizona, if I recall correctly).

Met up with a few old ""friends"" from high school, the slightly deranged, always droopy, possibly anarchist and sleazebag types, and I found out we liked to smoke weed together too. Some good memories, some bad.

It was also during this time that I met the first love of my life, and quite possibly, the most dangerous one too. I won't say her name, but I will say that I tolerated more than a man should ever have to deal with, and controlled my anger and pain more times than I can count. It taught me valuable lessons on the importance of having lines that do not get crossed, and I learned that I was not quite as strong as I thought I was.

I joined the Navy six months after meeting her, went to bootcamp, all the requisite schools, finally, the fleet, and deployment. 4 years had passed at this point, and without going into details, I found that she was unloyal to me, and she was the viper that pretended to be the dandelion, and I could no longer tolerate any more of her psychotic realities (cheating on me while I'm on leave to visit you and aborting my unborn child without telling me kind of does that to a man).

After this point of breakup, I considered suicide, and for the, so far, first and only time in my life, I actually attempted it. This scene may have well been taken out of a Shakespearean play, because it was tragically comical. Put a gun to my head, pulled the trigger, round refused to fire. Primer cap was busted. Obviously, someone or something was looking out for me, because no coincidence is that coincidental.

As a sidenote: really I'm just so fucking done with extending my services out to people without any reciprocation in return. The amount of effort I put into others is astounding sometimes, involving money, emotional support, inspiration... but I never really receive anything in return, most of the time.

Back to the topic...

After the breakup with the now ex-fiance, I decided to try the dating world and I extended out beyond my typical reach to find, what I guess I could call, the one. Obviously, I haven't succeeded, but I think I've isolated the traits and emotional characteristics that cause problems for me.

It's both my fault and their fault. It's their fault for being psychotic, manipulative, spoiled rotten, and not used to thinking for others that they don't fully understand, as well as jumping to conclusions. It's my fault for being too nice and lenient, not setting boundaries, and not listening to the voices in my head when I'm being given obvious signs that the certain person I'm interested in, is in no way shape or form good for my own well being.

It sounds selfish and short-sighted, sure, but the most important person in the world is myself. This isn't intended to be a statement based on a fact that you can research, it's based on the relative perception of myself. Everyone should always be their own most important person.

The point of teamwork, and being in a relationship in general, at least from my perspective, is understanding that while you are the most important person to yourself, in the grand scheme of things, their successes and failures are also indeterminately linked to your own now.

That is how marriages and partnerships succeed.

Both parties have a goal and are willing to achieve that goal.

Kind of the statement of the human condition, to be honest. The human mind is almost entirely incentive driven. We seek a reward for our actions, whether it be through social acknowledgement, finances, or just general success in whatever we do in life.

Isn't that the point of life?

To roll with the punchlines and strike out an existence that means something, not to other people, but to yourself?

I would like to think that...

(Dates don't really matter here, this article will continue to be updated with random threads on an indeterminate basis until my own existence cancels out, or I find what I'm looking for.)

Let's talk about love now...

I think Rick and Morty had a very solid point when relating to the article of ""love."" Love is simply a chemical reaction in your brain, releasing increased levels of dopamine and other ""feel-good"" chemicals that tells your body that this person is worth your time (I'm sure my fellow chemists and physicians could probably explain that a bit better).

Love is basically life's greatest trick.

Life, or rather, your perception of life is the greatest illusion that your existence ever gave you.

In the grand scheme of the universe, an uncomfortable trend appears. In short, your life doesn't matter. Your existence does not determine the grand plan's course.

You could die right now, and the earth would continue spinning, the sun would continue shining (for another couple billion years, at least), and the universe as a whole would carry on with it's machinations as if you never existed in the first place.

Maybe this explains the correlation that links intelligence and depression so close to each other... probably.

As the same applies to us, so to does it apply to possibly other civilizations out there. One of them could pass on, and it would not affect our daily lives in the slightest category.

But I digress...

To bring this all to a close before further updates present themselves, I am lost. I feel without hope.

I don't have an incredible wife to support me.

I don't have a family that would understand me.

I don't have many friends that would make me feel any better about the finality of being born unto a world that attempts to destroy you until it finally succeeds in that dreary task.

Does this article make any sense? Probably not.

I wouldn't necessarily even say that this is a suicide note. I'm always in an effort to treat life like the grand joke it is. What's the point of ending it early?

I also understand that there are quite a few people out in the world who would be absolutely devastated if something ever happened to me, and I'm trying to be responsible and understand that.

This isn't the spontaneous kind of depression; this is the depression caused by heartbreak, rejection, humiliation, and hubris, piled higher and higher as the years have continued.

This is the slow knife, so to speak.

While I'm not inherently at risk, at the moment, I do hope that others can see this and understand that this isn't an isolated incident. I'm writing this because I've finally reached the point where compartmentalization just won't cut it anymore.

I'm even at the point of selling my own things to get money that I need.  I can't afford to live so why bother?

Even if I drop out of my Masters now and start full-time work to support myself I'm still going to want to die because I'll be heartbroken to have given up my dreams and also everyone will be disappointed in me for dropping out. I don't see any point in carrying on. I'm exhausted. ",depression

suffocating limbs and eyes 
grossed out just because...they try
the process of destruction, oh my, oh my,
become justified in a way that is so fake (FAKE!)

look in the eyes, the eyes,
of demonized gods, but they’re not in the skies!
crystallized-ized-ized- blood is trapped in no eyes
Blood is never thickened it wastes itself in flows
That, far from the source, 
is where location lies,

Passion after passion and dreamlike (It’s so corroded, un-friend..)
What? What?
I’m not your friend?
So blood thickened it fell from the skies
Trickled down, down
It bleeds out
And, GOD, does it make me die! (FIE! My eye!)",depression
297761,"Everyone hates meOkay...I give my mom hints by talking down about myself (I'm an idiot, what if I died; what would my family do if I died) and always talk about ways to kill myself. I nearly confessed that I hated myself for everything. But everytime I try to tell someone about; two things are stopping me. One: The fact that I am an introverted person (Kinda a tsundere) and I can't open up to people I know very well. Two: MY MOM WON'T LISTEN!!! She told me I can talk to her about anything....but if it is not of any importance to her, then she'd just wave me off. I tried venting to her, but then I turn and see her on the phone. It's like she doesn't care her teenager is suicidal and wants to die by killing herself. She just doesn't listen, it's like she doesn't want to hear my voice or see me again.

My siblings are like that too. But we hear each other out, and agree with what the other says. It's like someone started to listen. But a while ago, I heard all three of them (all boys) talking trash about me. One even came to my face and told me: ""You should just die."" Me right now: ""If I am such a bugger, how about I kill myself? Would you'd be satisfied you don't have a sister to worry about anymore? Of course you would. No one listens.""

I don't miss any of the good times I've had with my family. They all just had fake smiles on their faces, while I yap away like I'm a mental person. I can't crack jokes like any of them can, I can't speak to anyone like they can, I can't bring the courage to even vent to anyone.

109379,"I'm waning.So since I became a mid teen, my life has felt like complete total hell. I would like to sit down and talk about it, because I am waning. I am very close to wanting to end my life. 

Ever since my mother met her current husband, I have been deprived of a family, or even love. My mother used up a bunch of her money for her wedding, then she left me and my two brothers to fend for ourselves in New York. At this time, I had been in a rocky relationship with my ex-boyfriend. Mostly because I was in love with (my current lover, whom is now my fiance.)  I felt I wouldn't be able to do anything as a 17 (or 16) year old male, so I went to live with him not knowing precisely in what kind of area he lived at. He lived in New Hamsphire in the middle of nowhere in the swamps, not fun and not good when I had a waning mentality, so I felt chained and stuck which reduced my mental state greatly. Mostly since I felt alone the entire time, now to state further. When I feel alone, I tend to cope with my personalities as I have multiple, thus talking to myself. Just to say, it's not a great experience. 

Moving forward, I broke up with him since I was extremely unhappy and my mental state was only worsening and thus he kicked me out of the house. I seeked help from my god mother, since my mother didn't want anything to do with me, and my god grandmother, let me stay in her home.  The issue was, they gave me two weeks to find both a job and an apartment. I couldn't, so I returned to New York and I had nothing there. My brothers gave me space for living, but I didn't have anything to do for about 14 hours a day besides stare at a wall, which activated my coping to speak to myself which drove me further down a rabbit hole. But overnight, I was able to play, so I slept about 2 hours, spent my days trying to cope, and my nights playing with friends who eventually all left me.

I met up again with the girl I had an immense crush on 4 to 5 years ago, and I was single, she was dating someone. I had tried dating people after my ex boyfriend, but they were bad people, one was an old friend who only just had me about to hurt me further and further down a rabbit hole, making me feel like a terrible person. But I won't talk about them.

I met up with my fiance, but she was with someone. She and I hung out, called all day and night, thus she was bringing me back down to earth metaphorically. She broke up with her boyfriend to get with me, and I promised her I'd make her infinitely happy for the rest of her life, I still do. I went down to Texas hoping her family would be reasonable, and at first they weren't, but then I came back and the grandparents let me stay with them. I helped around the house and everything, but then after a few months my fiancé's cousin caused drama and the grandparents kicked me out of the house. 

Let me just state, I was warned the cousin is a liar and has mental problems. She exposed to me that she has a crush on me, while she knew I was engaged to my fiance, yet she attempted to make moved onto me, like kissing me, the night before I was kicked out. 

Ever since then I have been house hopping, but I feel I have come to a halt and it's only been making me lose hope. The closer I get to Christmas the more fated I feel, to not see my fiance and to be homeless. I draw myself closer, even when I was living with my fiance to kill myself, I have even put a knife to my throat, or even a gun. But I think about her and I don't do it, because she means the world to me. But things like having nightmares everyday recently, and her being too busy with family has been fading her farther and farther and have drawn me closer to killing myself, I don't want to do it, I really don't, but I also don't want to keep living anymore. I am asking for genuinely any help, because I love my fiance. I don't want to kill myself and ruin her, I want to live and be with her, or I wouldn't have taken the time to even write all of this. 

(I have told my mother I am going homeless and she cares for her husband's kids, and not her own if anyone is asking, I have asked all of my friends for help. But no one is available, and my fiancé's grandparents threatened to call the police on me if I ever set foot on their property.)",depression

I know these people say shit about me the second i turn around, I know that I'm an ugly bastard that's just going to be alone for a long ass time before I settle with someone who I don't find attractive just so I can say I didn't die alone. 2 and a half years of crying over nothing and wondering when it's going to start getting better. The suicidal thoughts never end, I think about it daily. I can just imagine the bastards tweeting some bullshit like ""another suicide at our school, guess nobody learns"" I can imagine them all saying stuff about how everyone loved me, and no one was rude. That's the only reason I haven't gone through and done it yet, because I think it would be a waste if I didn't get to see how everyone reacts and fronts on some bullshit like how much everyone loved me. I probably end up doing it anyway, just to get away and end the constant worrying about ""oh I wonder if she actually likes me"" ""am I texting her too much"" ""why doesn't he stop being a cock and staring at me like he wants to fight""

Yesterday in English class we did the Second Coming, which is a poem by W.B. Yeats about the end of the world. And someone made a joke about transgenders being the antichrist. Anyway this fucking lad who thinks he's the shit and has a bit of a harem of lads too scared to object what he says went off on how trans people are a scourge and should live with the hand that they were dealt and the then the teacher started supporting him. I would have argued with him but I didn't (look I'm a bit of a coward ok?). Later I spoke to my friend about it and he said that basically that would have been the equivalent of outing myself and would have essentially ruined my life. This lad could fucking argue black was white and anyone who disagreed would get abused by him and his clique. Like getting the shit kicked out of each other.

Surely whoever inhabitated this shell died, only for the body to continue it's meaningless March to Oblivion.

There is nothing left. No mind to nurture, no soul to save. Just a hollow husk. Pay it no mind as you pass it by, for it you do, just for a second, it might hope.

346632,"a few opinions no one asked for but theyre here anyways 

this subs dry rn and i wanna debate so heres a few opinions that may be controversial:

pls keep it civil, and any personal or derogatory attacks will be blocked and probably reported :D

1) trans people (who have gone through both genitalia surgery and hormonal therapy) arent obligated to tell you theyre trans. 

take it this way: a trans woman used to be a man, that is in their past. no sane person is gonna go to every date and spill out all their hot juicy trauma on the table for you to determine whether you wanna date them or not. dont expect a trans person who completely looks and passes as a cis woman/man to tell you right off the bat that theyre trans. 

in a way, its kinda like getting plastic surgery. most times (if it goes well at least) you cant tell theyve had surgery. so unless you specifically ask “have you had plastic surgery before?”, that person otherwise has no reason to tell you, unless of course they choose to, which is completely fine.

2) cringe culture is the single handedly most annoying thing ever ngl. calling something you simply dont enjoy or are interested in “cringe” is annoying asf. i wish we could go back to the days of “if youve got nothing nice to say, dont say anything at all”.

literally what benefit does it give to anyone to comment “lmao ur cringy” or “cringe” on a post of a topic YOU specifically dont enjoy, but others do? 

and yes i know you want to comment cringe under this post :|

3) most people here on reddit hated on tik tok before it was even widely known that there was spyware. this is mostly connected to my previous point, most people hated on it for being “cringe”. 

dont use that “it sexualised kids!!” argument on me, tik tok did not invent twerking, they did not invent lip syncing, they did not invent pedophilia, get your head out of your ass. 

if youre gonna hate on tik tok for supposedly supporting/advertising minors being sexualised, i hope you put that same energy into literally most websites/apps/forums/groups/videos/photos/compnies etc. on the internet. 

4) not everyone is able to get professionally diagnosed, stop hating on everyone who self diagnoses. sometimes there is genuinely no other option. yes there are people who self diagnose for attention and they are quite literally the scum of the earth, but dont generalise the ones who make the premise of it look bad with everyone else. 

5) fuck reddit, this place is a shithole with constant toxicity. not to mention the upv*te downv*te system makes it easy to not have an opinion and practically force people who care about k*rma to only comment widely accepted ideas rather than what they actually wanna say.

331435,"25 Years of SuicideMy suicidal ideation started at 9 due to trauma. That was also the first time I self harmed and drew blood. I continued to be traumatized through various unfortunate events and environmental conditions periodically throughout my life. I have struggled not to kill myself for 25 years now. My dad and aunt both killed themselves and my brother and myself have both attempted suicide. Extended family- My mom’s aunt, cousin, and uncle all killed themselves.

Everyday it is a struggle to wake up.

I have no friends, no close family aside from a complicated relationship with my NPD mother who I hear from occasionally, and rarely have had any close connections.

Even if I do meet someone nice I’m so frightened for them to know and reject me I try to keep them at arms length. Because I’ve come to learn my background makes it hard for others to relate to me. 

I was in various friendships and relationships throughout the years and the moment they knew about my past, or my trauma, or hospitalizations, or therapy, or family history, it was like I was no longer a person. I wasn’t an equal. I was an alien, some foreign creature they no longer recognized. 

They immediately would act differently. And any natural emotion I had was no longer respected as valid.

Following a change in reception, I would either be undermined and infantilized, openly pitied, or ignored.

No matter how compromising, or understanding, or quiet I became just to have any interaction with others, even if I was treated subhuman, it changed nothing for me positively.

Over time I just forgot how to even try to have a relationship with others at all. I forgot how to talk. I became very shy and reclusive.

I learned through countless rejections that if people knew my whole story, I’d be ghosted or excluded. No one likes to feel pity or uncomfortable feelings, and no one can relate, I get it.

But I get so tired of being a Martian.

It’s so lonely.

I’m naturally a fun, joking, light hearted person. Like literally that’s how people describe me “ Fun!”

But the moment people ask, and I open up, things change.

I’ve been excluded as long as I can remember.

I miss my dad and my aunt especially.

They never excluded me. They were both very loving people.

My father and I were very close. He was my best and often only friend.

I know eventually I’m going to kill myself because I don’t know how many more years I can continue to live like this.

Are some people so devalued by the stigma of trauma that they no longer have a worth in society?

It may not be now in this instant. But I know at some point, maybe soon,  I’ll break again, and I won’t be able to hold back from the hopelessness. At 25 years, I don’t think anyone could argue I didn’t try my best.",depression

Like I could jump and it would all just end and no one would know why, not even me. And a large part of me really wants to do it. 

I don't know if this counts as suicidal honestly, it's not what the other posts are about... but it does scare me. 

More than jumping I want to stab myself in the stomach. And, this seems so gross outside of my head, pull out my intestines? I kind of want to feel my own organs in my hands. Again, I don't know why. I think about a moment when something went wrong, something forgettable, like using one word when I should have used a better one. Or a moment when a friend called me out on the bullshit I wasn't ready to face. Or something. I forgot to do a task that was important. Someone catcalled me out of their van. It could be anything.

266401,"fear and laziness about transitionhi all, how are you?

the cornerstone of my story that needs to be clarified before anything else is: I will end my life and the decision is final.

the support I seek is somewhat lateral.

I am a 32F recently graduated from medical school. in order to get my license in my country, I have to first complete some clinical rotations (atm, almost finished) and then a few more months to process the license.

once the license process clears, I will apply for a residency program in a different province, moving away from my hometown once I graduated has been a decision for decades.

I will move cities and begin working as a physician. I will end my life around that time.

I am not ill, al least not anymore. I had severe mental health problems for decades, but I was cleared of any on going diagnoses a few months back.

I have been thinking about it and I can't find the ethics in forcing people to live when they simply don't wish to.

my reasons for suicide are not medical (i.e., depression or such).

the thing is. and here's where I need some orientation. I have some 7-8 months to go before I get my license, move and start residency. I don't want to go without my diploma, graduating medical school has been exceedingly grueling and it's worth it. and the hardest part: I have to prepare to sit for the exam. I don't know what residency exams are like in other countries, but it is like nothing ever known even to medical school graduates. it's grueling enough to just prepare to sit for a residency exam, let alone do that while simultaneously being suicidal.

my only idea is getting therapy for this transition, but I could get forcefully hospitalised and that's not a helpful solution for my reasons to end life.

how do I face the following months?

I want to die. Like genuinely. I don't want to get better, I don't want the other side, I want to be dead. But I don't wanna regret it yknow? It seems so fuckin perfect. Like I can't fuck up once I'm dead. Nobody has to put up with me once I'm dead. I can't keep hurting people once I'm dead. Like, it's peaceful. Better for everyone in the long run.

I find myself pushing everyone away, thinking that they'll eventually stop caring, but instead I end up hurting them. Ideally, everyone would just stop giving a shit, then id have no guilt. I think about ways I could go, but I don't want to effect anyone that finds my body. I live near a train track, perhaps that would be good? It'll fuck me up so bad maybe they won't even realise I was a person. Although I usually think I'd drink a shit tonne, then od on something. Haven't quite figured out what. I take comfort in knowing that suicide is always an option. I could choose to make everything better, but instead I insist on punishing myself and those around me. I can't decide if I'm worthy of the escape, tbh. Like, I'm a shitty person so maybe I deserve to suffer by being alive. Or perhaps life is so good that I don't deserve to be alive. It often feels like every good thing in my life I turn into a way to hurt myself. I am a toxic person, I do not understand why people still care. Make it stop... God please make it stop. I've even turned therapy into a way to emotionally abuse myself. I was supposed to get meds, but im 15 so they won't prescribe any. At this point I'm sick of trying. I'm so fucking tired of not getting better. I'm so fucking sick of living. Nothing feels worth it. We're all gonna die one day anyway? I suppose the dilemma comes down to whether or not I think life is a blessing, and I guess that's a difficult question to answer for anybody, not just someone who wants to die.  

It doesn't hurt me to know that the world would be better without me in it. In fact, only a tiny fraction of the population would know. This is why I don't like people telling me the world is better with me in it. Its not, I know it's not. I'm fine with that. Say I continue to live and it wasn't worth it? I've just wasted peoples time, their effort. Its not going to be worth it.

There's truly very little I care about. And I certainly don't care about myself. Sure I want everyone to be okay, like I don't want anything bad to happen to anyone, but I don't care enough to sit and listen to people or help them? Like, if I car was going to hit someone, I'd switch places. Perhaps not to save them, but more to kill myself, but I don't exactly want them to die either. I suppose it's just easier to go out in a horrific accident than have suicide attached to my name forever, maybe more dignified?

All I really wanted was peace, and I can't have that because everything is blurry and loud. I'm void of any coping at it feels like it will kill me. If you think about it really, there's not much of a downside? Aside from the stigma, and potentially hurting people. But that's inevitable, they'll get over it. That's what happens, people move on. 

I guess I'm not sure the point in writing this, I don't want pity, I'm not sure anything anybody says is gonna change it, yknow? Such as life. I think I'm just gathering my thoughts. I don't know how to not feel like this. Its getting more difficult to do anything, and in all honesty, I don't know how much longer before it kills me. In afraid I don't know what that means.

People keep telling me “things will get better” I don’t think they will. I think I’m different. You can read my previous posts for a background of my symptoms. Anyways the only way I kind find any sort of joy at this point is by distancing myself from the world. Playing video games and being high are the only things that make me feel anything.

I digress, I think that I’m doing a disservice to myself and my family if I continue to live. A. I am putting myself in pain for no reason. I don’t think there is a point for me to suffer any longer. For a long time the thing that kept me from seriously considering suicide as my exit strategy was my family. 

Recently I came to the realization that I’m not going to get better. If I continue to live I will only be in pain for the rest of my life. This brings me to my second point. B. It’s unfair to keep my family hopeful. I’ve accepted the fact that My life on earth is done. I think it’s a fucked up thing to do to keep them thinking that things will turn around when they never will. It’s best to end my life so that they can let the thought of me go and get on with their lives.

I am pretty sure I’m going to go through with it. I’m going to go to one more therapy session. I’ll tell my therapist about my thoughts and give him a chance to convince me otherwise. My last hope is that these are just delusional thoughts that every person who is “depressed” has. Sadly I’m confident that I’m thinking clearly. 

I wish that I hadn’t been born. I wish that I didn’t have to worry about the well being of my family. It makes this so much harder. I want to get over with this and just be gone. Every time i look at any of my family members I want to cry. They have no clue how much pain I’m going to cause them. I hope they are all right. I fear I’m going to cause my parents to get a divorce or cause one of my family members to fall into depression. The world would be better without me. If I simply didn’t exist. Fuck this.

I digress, I’ll probably write a goodbye note to reddit. I’ll write one to my family and I will write a note to the world and society in general. 

Until then, I’m unsure of how I’m going to kill my self. I’m scared of using a knife or hanging myself. I don’t think I could cut myself and I’m scared banging myself won’t work. I don’t think I can get my hands on a gun because I live in an extremely privileged white community In the suburbs of Grand Rapids. I think the person who I would ask for a gun would be suspicious of me. I’ve thought about using my car but I don’t think I should fuck my parents over financially as well. This all leads me to pills. I don’t know what I would use but I need it to work. Surviving would be too much pain for me and for my family.

69941,"I feel empty.First of all, I just want to say. I know I’m not the worst off person, I know some people would be overwhelmed to live the way I do. 
The thing is, I’m just empty, sad and feel terribly alone. 

Secondly, I’m not sure if this is the right place to vent and I can’t guarantee I’ll make any sense. 

For the last 10 years, I’ve felt alone, numb and have struggled to find any light in any situation. 

I went through years (4) of feeling numb, with no emotion. I struggle with depression and anxiety. I’m on high alert all the time, it’s exhausting. 

I work, 0830-1700 Monday to Friday. It barely pays the bills. So no money for luxuries. I have an apartment. The added stress from having less than 5 in the bank a week from the end of the month tips me over the edge. Sometimes I’ll sit and stare at the wall until I go to bed once I’m home from work. 

I frequently have the urge to just end it all, kill myself. I mean, I don’t feel as I anyone would care. Other than my mother. She’s the only reason I haven’t. 

I’m weak, and I know I have to push on and live my life. I just wish I could enjoy it. ",depression

54005,"I want to kill myself because I can’t function in societySo, this is my third time planning to kill myself within the past few months so I guess I’m reaching out here to see if there’s some solution that I’m missing. Because killing myself seems like the only real solution.  

 &amp;nbsp;

I feel like I’ve tapped out all my resources and can no longer function the way I used to, which, although was never as highly functioning as someone without mental illness (I’ve suffered with depression since I was 11 and developed anxiety and insomnia along the way), I still made it by. I’ve always struggled with work and would go through a lot of jobs till I found something that was right for me, and once I did I worked hard and was a really reliable person. I even was offered a supervisor promotion at my second job but I ended up moving to be with my family. In 2010 my dad died suddenly and it left my family in ruins, I guess you could say. We lost everything and I had to take care of my mom and sister financially... and then I had to remove them from my life because I couldn’t afford to keep taking care of them and they were not working. Eventually I moved in with my best friend and struggled with jobs due to depression and panic attacks but usually could hold one down for 2 months to a year. I pursued things that made me happy when I could (hobbies, friends, dating). After a couple of years I had a really severe panic episode that caused me to lose my job again (I’d been through maybe 15-20 jobs at that point). Finally I decided to see a psychiatrist. I showed up every week in a zombie-like, barely responsive state. I felt completely traumatized that I could not handle work situations and kept losing jobs due to panic attacks. I couldn’t even go to the store when I needed something due to the anxiety. We did psychotherapy for $250 a week, but as you can imagine, I could not afford that on my minimum wage salary and had to end the psychotherapy sessions but continued seeing him monthly for a couple of years. I tried every medication he gave me, none of which helped, only caused different problems. Finally he said “well that’s it, there’s nothing else to try”. So I felt hopeless. The therapy hadn’t helped at all. I chose the medication with the least amount of side effects (Trazadone). I took it for a few years but eventually weened off of it because my psychiatrist retired and the meds weren’t doing anything except causing migraines.  

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to now... I’m a 30-year-old woman who is stuck? Working minimum wage entry level jobs. Last July I was fired from a job that I’d been at for 3 years, a record for me, but I had never been promoted during that time despite being a valuable employee (or so I thought). I had some savings so I thought this would be a good time to rediscover my passions in life and I did. I started making videos, doing YouTube, started up plans to make let’s plays and all that because I truly truly enjoyed it and it was fulfilling. I decided that’s what I want to do even if I have to work a soul-sucking minimum wage job. I will always make time for this new passion in life. I also thought this would be a great time to do school (a coding boot camp actually because I knew I wouldn’t have the time or funds to attend a 2-4 year college)... but when I tried to apply for a school loan, I was rejected because I didn’t have any credit and had no one to co-sign the loan. So, I thought, well maybe later—for now I’ll try to build my credit and get another job. Now, after taking about 8 months off to focus on my passions, building credit, and moving to a new city, I’ve blown through my savings and have been struggling to get or keep a regular job again. It feels really embarrassing applying for jobs that teenagers work at... people question why I’m trying to work at these types of jobs when I’m 30. Luckily, I look young but it’s still embarrassing. The truth is I’m not qualified for anything else and couldn’t get into school. Even if I did, I know I wouldn’t be able to handle school AND work... I can’t even handle work alone. I have panic attacks every couple days. I have severe depression spells that prevent me from moving my life forward or getting out of bed to go to work in the morning. I get paralyzed. Sometimes I’ll even get ready for work but then I’ll freeze and won’t be able to do the final step—walk out the door and go to work. I just... go back to bed, because I can’t bear the thought of going to these awful places. I hate these jobs so much and want to do something that makes me happy. Like making videos. Editing videos. Making games. Playing games. Being creative. Talking. Anything besides going to be someone’s fast food servant. The thing is I have no choice. I HAVE to work to survive and pay bills. Maybe I could go to school someday yes, maybe I could make some money from live-streaming games someday yes... but what I’m worried about is NOW. Right now... I can’t seem to hold a job for more than 1 to 14 days. I’m broke. I’ve almost been homeless and evicted so many times these last few months. The only reason I haven’t is because my best friend is picking up all my slack—and I hate that. I don’t want to be a drain and a burden anymore. But I don’t know how to fix this. I will spend days filling out applications, going to interviews, trying so hard to convince people to give me a job. But when I get the job, the depression and anxiety take over. And I get paralyzed and eventually can’t go anymore. Sometimes on the first day. I... I really am going to be homeless. I don’t have any family to stay with. My friend cannot carry me. I’ve maxed out almost all my credit cards. I don’t qualify for any loans (due to unemployment). I can’t afford another psychiatrist. I take Xanax, but it only helps with the panic episodes, not the crushing depression which also prevents me from going to work. I’m stuck. I’ve researched how to be homeless and survive and I can’t do it. I don’t want to live like that. I’d rather be dead. I really would rather be dead. So here I am, again, trying to decide if I should max out my last credit card on a gun and be done with this cycle of suffering and rapid progression downhill... or should I max out my last credit card so I can buy groceries for another month and just... keep trying. Even though I do keep trying and the result is always the same. I have good days where I feel hopeful and think “I can do this, maybe” but something always knocks me back down the next day, or day after that. And I’m back to square one. Like, for every step forward there’s 10 steps back.  

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like if getting evicted wasn’t a constant thought on my mind, yes I’d still be depressed, yes I’d still think about killing myself sometimes, because I always have. But I don’t think I would be planning to actually DO it... but I think I’ve finally reached the end and I have no other choice. Is there something I’m missing? I don’t know what else to do. I can’t deal with being homeless on top of everything. I just can’t. ",depression
116726,"Not sure if this group can be helpful. My suicidal 13 year old daughter.Because Sarah's anxiety seems to have been worsening recently, and because she could not articulate what exactly was wrong, we decided to audit her email account over the weekend, which is something we rarely do, preferring to give her her privacy.

Unfortunately we found a fair amount of suicidal talk. It was very general and not every day, no plans or agreements, in fact most of it was enumerating reasons why she could not or would not kill herself, but she has obviously given it thought. She has been discussing her depression with E, who recently moved away, and the two of them seem to have been reinforcing each other's anxiety and depression rather than helping each other. There has been a 24 hour a day (nearly), 7 day a week email conversation going on between Sarah, E, and two other girls about their extreme anxiety, angst, and feelings of depression and fear. I'm no expert but this seems like ""corumination.""

In response we have temporarily removed Sarah's access to email and the internet at home and confiscated her cell phone. She was taking her phone to bed so that she could literally respond to these emails all day long, every day, about every 2-5 minutes.

Just the absence of this 24/7, non-stop conversation seems to have taken some weight off of her shoulders and Sarah was in seemingly high spirits last night while we focused on family activities. Obviously we are still very concerned and are seeking a therapist outside of school for Sarah. We are especially concerned about Sarah during school hours, where she may not be able to disengage from drama with her peers when/if she needs to. I'm also concerned about some of Sarah's teacher's interactions with her, particularly the French teacher who seems especially interested in Sarah in a negative way for some reason. I understand that she recently forced Sarah to get on her hands and knees in the hallway and clean up discarded and smashed food that was left by another student, which humiliated her in front of her peers and seemed to be a little bizarre (not to mention that Sarah is immune-compromised by her Crohn's and the attendant medications and this could have been dangerous.)

Sarah was seen yesterday evening by emergency crisis workers who have determined that she's not an imminent threat to herself warranting hospitalization. They're coming back again tonight (not sure what for exactly.) We're looking for a regular therapist/psychologist as well.

Sarah is chronically ill. She has Crohn's Disease, ITP (a blood clotting disorder), and constant dull pain throughout her entire body that began with a bad medication reaction and has never gone away. Sometimes the pain intensifies and immobilizes her, about twice a year. This has been her life for 10 years, though it's been worse for about 4 years. I think this contributes to her sadness, but I don't think it's the source. Her biological mom (not her step mom who she lives with) has a history of clinical depression.

I'm not sure exactly how, as her dad, to relate to her and help her with this. Since puberty/turning 13 she really doesn't confide much in us anymore. Conversations with her are extremely one sided IF the subject is her feelings (fine on all other subjects). She's seemingly happy and smiling when interacting with family like her little sister, me, and her mom AS LONG AS we don't bring up her sadness or the reasons for it. At school, her friends seem to reinforce her sad feelings rather than help much.

I've offered Sarah a limited return of access to her email account but she has declined. I'm a little worried that she's already created an alternate account that she can access from school, but she declined to go to school today, citing a fear of one specific teacher that she doesn't think she can handle today. It's possible, though, that she simply realizes that she needs a break from constant contact with her depressed friends.",depression

**TL;DR: My professor told me I should “take life less seriously” and she’s right.**

So I was apologizing to one of my favorite professors for fucking up in her class last semester. It wasn’t about the grade, I actually got an A- (which I honestly didn’t deserve and I think she did it out of pity) but because I turned in everything late and my papers weren’t nearly as good as they usually are/should have been.

I was embarrassed and disappointed in myself because I was so excited for this class and passionate about the subject but I had some personal problems/mental health issues/procrastination and I really blew it. You have to understand that, as immature as this probably sounds, I really really look up to this particular professor as a mentor and scholar. I’ve read her research and discussed it with her. She’s given me lots of book and movie recommendations. We’ve talked outside of class about art and philosophy and mental illness and life in general. I try not to burden her too much, and to give her space, because I know she’s not my friend, or parent, but she’s been so encouraging and motivating to me, and shown me a lot of kindness and sympathy when my depression, OCD, and PTSD stated to become more and more obvious (I was eventually hospitalized in the middle of the semester once).

Anyway, I told her how much I genuinely enjoyed the class and learned from it, despite my poor performance, and admitted that I was disappointed in myself and wished I could do it over again. She told me I needed to “take life less seriously” and that I perhaps cared “a little too much” about her class for my own good. She was very sympathetic (as always), but it made me realize how I come across and how I need to change that.

I know she’s right. I now feel so ridiculous for caring so much about everything. I really want to stop being so self-absorbed and taking everything so seriously and just relax, but I do really care about the impression I’ve made, not in everyone, but on her and my other mentors. I need to just stop caring so much. I KNOW it doesn't matter. I KNOW I need to focus more on other people and less on myself, I just don't know HOW. I will try, at any rate.",non-depression

I just got told my parents were separating, didnt see my dad in months and had to accompany my mom to tribunals because she was fighting for my tutelage (I guess thats the word im looking for?...) I missed my dad so much and I couldnt believe they were separated so I tried to stab my belly with a kitchen knife, spent some days in hospital. Next time I happened to felt useless for some reason I don't recall anymore and drinked bleach or whatever that thing was, pair of days in hospital and back home, I think I was 9 that time. Two months later I went for a excursion to some forest and shit and I got hella pissed at some girl for whatever reason I think it had something to do with our activities and started yelling at her, my teacher then started scolding me for treating girls like that. Then I threw myself down a hill and just had a few scratches and a broken leg. 14 years old, lovesick, tried cutting my wrists to bleed to death, got caught and put into a useless psychologist that all it did was to grab my dads cash. 17years old, had a long distance relationship with a girl and after she visit me for the first time, we had sexual intercourse like, raw. Week after she went back to her town she started saying she was afraid to be pregnant and that she didnt wanted to bother me at my 17s with a kid so she blocked me from everywhere, I just wanted her back and would have loved if she was indeed pregnant as a kid would have definitely meant something to wake up in the mornings for. Not being able to withstand the situation I was going to jump off a bridge but I gor mugged on my way there and the police saw me half naked in the street in the middle of the night and brought me back home, parents werent home so they never knew of this. 19 years old, few days after my birthday I had a discussion with my gf (same one that blocked me thinking she was pregnant) because she kept going around with a guy I knew she was cheating me with even though she said she was some guy she played League of Legends with, that one day she was in my flat (back then I was living in her town, around 10minutes walking from her) sleeping and her phone started getting messages from the guy, I saw how she basically sext him all the time and stuff, so that night I went to a cliff that was near my home and was about to jump down until she grabbed me from behind hugging me. Nowadays, I at most just cut my wrists a bit just to feel pain when I am sad, but havent really tried killing myself.

In May I was diagnosed with leukemia. The first thing out of my mouth was, ""I don't want to die"". And every day since, it has been the topic of my life. I wonder, if I knew how much stress and frustration, how much more suffering I'd do, would I have said that? I don't know.

53528,"The current situation in Belarus I’m an American that’s been following the recent developments in Belarus, I think more people should be informed about the ongoing situation there. 

Belarus is currently led by dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, and the most recent “elections” were held on August 9, where Lukashenko “won” &gt;80% of the vote. People are angry because their freedoms have been superseded by the regime, and also because of the fact that the Belarusian government has consistently rigged elections in Lukashenko’s favor. 

The government has come down hard on the protesters, with riot police leading a brutal crackdown of dissidents in Minsk with sheer force, and even firing live rounds of ammunition at the protesters. The Lukashenko regime is committing numerous human rights violations against their own people so he can continue to stay in power. 

By making this post, I hope that I can spread the word about the ongoing protests in Belarus and shed some light on the situation. And to the people of Belarus, I hope that y’all can topple the dictatorship and hold free and fair elections.",non-depression

66455,"People defending child pornography at my school today So, 3rd period English class( i don't come from a English country so this was to practice argumenting)

We were on a stranded island, and we could choose 3 People to save.

1 a prostitute who gave 30% of their earnings to homeless children

2 a drug addict who could write incredible pieces of music

3 a dying old man who was a military veteran

4 a child pornographer who helps millions of People as a spiritual leader at a church

5 a convicted criminal who was an incredible sculptor

6 a corrupt politician who made a system which helps the poor and needy

The other 3, would die.

So, now, onto my choises. I choose the prostitute, corrupt politician and the drug addict(it was a close one between this person and the criminal).

So, we were put in Pairs and we had to argument until we had the same choises. My partner, who chose the dying old man instead of the drug addict. I convinced her of the drug addict. Now, groups of 4. One girl chose the convicted criminal instead of the drug addict. This is where the argumenting really began. Very good Points were made, but i eventually won.

Now, groups of 8. We all already had the same choises so yeah.

Now. The final showdown. 2 groups of 8.

They choose: 

The prostitute

The corrupt politician

And the fucking child pornographer

We were... Well.. shocked. But hey, let's hear their reasons 

""Oh yeah what if they were like 16 or 17""

No, you fucking idiot. Even if they were their still underage and non consensual- legit words i said

Then it got serious. So, our turn. The drug addict could be a famous mucisian and help millions! The child pornographer may help People, but he is still a Disgusting person!

Their response. I'm not kidding. This was their response.

""Yeah but like what if he isn't a pedophile and does it for money""

My response: are you stoopid Fam?

So, i yelled: A GAY PORNSTAR WOULD NEVER FUCK A GIRL, BESIDES, ANYONE WITH A NORMAL BRAIN WOULD NEVER FUCK KIDS, HE IS A PEDO!

Then i realised we we're all being very subjectieve. So, i Came up with a very objective argument. Yeah, so, the famous musician could stop doing drugs through rehab and stuff, and help hundreds of millions of People do the same. And, besides, he's not replacable. A spiritual leader? Hell yeah! You can't just replace Micheal Jackson or Elvis Presley like that!

It's about time I kill myself, I just don't know how, I'm too scaredMan I don't care about opinions and I won't judge anyone. What's the point of it all, isn't it going to end someday. Judge, attack, and even persecute whoever your beliefs and ideals don't align with, it won't matter in the grand scheme of things (cuz it's all pointless). People getting all jumpy and uppity about genocide while it's a very good thing in my opinion for a person too cowardly to take his/her own life. Or getting uptight about other crimes like theft, murder, rape, and pedophilia. All of it doesn't matter, all of it is pointless nothing not even fiction, (oh ah sorry I mean religion) can help you get out off this existential void. Fuck life. Fuck cause and effect.
You know, in my opinion, the worst and most painful thing is how indifferent the universe and cause and effect are. Just painful. No regard for ""fairness"" or ""justice"". You just play the game with the cards you've been given, limited by your own body and mind from becoming (your) ideal/perfect person. I've always been told that I  catastrophize a lot but I think I'm being realistic. Life is pointless but y'all (at least most of you who follow ""morality"" and ""goodness"") are just too cowardly to look reality and the ultimate meaninglessness of life right in the eye. But I don't blame you, we all have our limits and weaknesses, I for one can't bring myself to commiting suicide, I'm not brave enough. I hide behind a facade (search for painless death) and convince myself that it's better that way. But killing yourself is the best and most honest response to a crappy world like ours. If I could I would kill all of you instead, every single human alive—dead. Imagine yourself, you, as the last human alive. Wouldn't it be fucking great, what a nice peaceful life it would be. But that's just a pipe dream, killing yourself is way more practical and realistic.

However, now I'm fearing that it might be a big mistake, seeing as I am feeling worse and worse. I feel embarrassed to go out to eat because I don't feel as hungry, and don't want to offend my friends.

292871,"So here's an update. It gets worse...So here's my [original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/199oo1/i_think_about_it_every_day/) Where I go on about my wife and job etc.

Anyway, fast forward to today. My wife has her Facebook on my phone. She wanted to check it one night, so it's been logged in ever since. I decide to close some Safari windows and BAM. There it is. Right in the face. I didn't intend to see it and I wish I hadn't. An email exchange between her and her girl friend. Apparently she's ""wasted her 20s"", ""wants to be a whore for a night"", ""Have someone tell her she's sexy"" and ""what happens at (her friends) house, stays at (her friends) house"". Meanwhile, I'm here. Making advances every day. Telling her she looks great and I love her. This morning, she actually got mad about it. Saying how she doesn't need to be told every day. Sorry, but I accidentally stumbled upon your conversation and apparently that's what you want. **But not from me**.

So, this is it. I'm off today and I've had a few drinks and she's at work. No idea that I know about this little exchange. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know how to fix this. We've had some financial problems as of late, and I asked if we were ok even though all of that has occurred. She says all is well. But I know better. 

I don't know what to do. Someone please help. Give me some advice that might work, or anything. I can't have her leave me. Never mind for a GIRL. I couldn't take that. I do everything I can to make her happy. Fuck, I made breakfast at midnight last night because she was craving it. Who does that?? 

I've come so far since I met her. I was in a bad place before, similar to this, and she set me straight. If she goes, or does anything like they've all done before her, I don't know what I'd do. I'm not even talking about just girl in particular. Friends in general have always been dicks to me, regardless of what I've done for them. I'm already prepared. I've cleaned my house, done my laundry and the dog's been fed.

I've had depression for about 10 years or so and I've tried to commit suicide about 6 or so times. I live in a house with some friends. I guess this is where I should open up with things right? For about the last year or so I've been thinking about suicide almost daily. And I admit there are days I can conquer it but I just don't see why that much anymore. I firmly believe that the people I love would be happier without me. I know for a fact they care, I just can't get it through my head. I have a boyfriend and all I can ever think about when I look at him is ""How much happier will he be when I'm gone? How much am I holding him back? Why am I being so selfish and keeping him when he probably would be happier with someone else?"" ect. And while I can fight off depression and suicidal thoughts, I just want to give in. I want them to be happy. I'm tired of fighting and trying to act like shit didn't happen in my life. I know life is supposed to have loss in it, but some things that I have run into I think are just ridiculous. I'm scared and sad every night when I go to bed because I know I'm alone. I know in the darkness there my depression will come to be and try to persuade me to commit suicide. I can't really block it out anymore. All of my housemates know I'm suicidal, but I can't really have a talk like this with any of them. It adds so much stress on their lives and I'm really not worth it. A lot of the things that are making me hold on and the same reasons I want to die.

We started cleaning (vacuuming, moping, etc) when my siblings started calling me slurs (they weren’t helping cleaning btw). I told them to stop, but they didn’t. I eventually made my way to the car to take a break. My siblings said something to my mom and she came out and started yelling at me about how lazy I am.

241271,"I asked the girl I like out. Didn't go as planned. So last week I finished my school year. We ended classes on Friday 18th and I had been planning asking this girl out for some time already. Because of Covid-19 we couldn't really do much but a friend of mine told me I should ask her out to eat a burger for lunch after the last class. I texted her with a fun little effect that instagram dms have that wraps your message in a present to make it more casual (i think. that was my friend's idea) That was a week before. 

She takes a long time to answer my messages usually (almost everybody leaves me waiting like 7 hours then i answer in 4 seconds) so I had to wait. As days went by I kept asking her ""so where should we go?"" Or ""what time is best for you?"" But she didn't answer until one day when she told me that she ""wouldn't be able to go because a friend of her sister had a barbecue scheduled and maybe she'd have to go"". So I assumed that she just wasn't interested and I thought she'd rather go to her sister's event. 

But a day later, my class organized a little get-together to celebrate our last day of school. Since I thought that the girl would be busy I went to the little party. She showed up. Not only had she shown up, she had spent the night at the girl's house which the party was going to happen. 

I know I can't force her to go out with me and I am not entitled to her time nor anything like that. But I would lie if I said that didn't hurt a little. I'm not saying she lied to get out of my invitation but it did bug me for the weekend. 

At the party everybody got pretty drunk including her so, since I was one of the only people sober, I had to look over most of my classmates to make sure they didn't somehow die. They say that drunk people don't lie. I exchanged a couple of conversations with her here and there and my overall conclusion is that she isn't really interested in me.  The rest of the night was really fun and I had a good time with my friends. 

On Saturday however, I receive a message from her thanking me for taking care of her during the event. I told her ""sure. no problem."" But she never answered. Didn't even leave me on read. 

So here I am. Confused and telling people on the internet that my crush doesn't care about me at 3:06 in the morning. Anyways this post dragged for too long already. Just wanted to talk about it a little.

202692,"I don't want to die, but I don't see any choice.I came to SW to help people. I thought helping others would help me. But after quite a while of reading posts, I realised that I'm in no position to help despite how much I really want to. I don't really know how, and that hurts because I really want to help. So I suppose I've resorted to making my own post now.

I don't want to die at all, you see. I want to live a happy life, see things, discover things, love things, hear things. I want to enjoy the summer and build snowmen in winter. But I feel like I have no choice anymore, because there is no happiness for me and I can't do those things.

I'm 23, and I have a disability which makes it almost impossible for me to walk. I can very short distances - perhaps down the stairs to the den, or to the bathroom - with aids such as a prop (I hate saying stick) and holding onto walls, but then I absolutely have to stop. I usually just use the walls. 

I can't even use a motorized wheelchair or scooter, because my disability affects my co-ordination and eyesight.. and over stimulation of the senses can set my body off haywire too, and make me very ill with a chance of landing me in hospital. So even if I had someone to push a chair for me.. which I don't.. I would still be stuck in this house, this room. I have been for years now, since my health degraded as a teen.

The doctors can't help, they say it seems incurable. They say it seems like a mix of things. They can see the affects on my body with tests, but they dont see the root of how or why. They're sympathetic, but after looking at me for 7 years, they can't help.

I hate seeing 'what about the people who love you?!' as a reason to live, because I have none. I get so frustrated when I see people say that.. even if its not directed at me.. it's like rubbing it in my face. Is it so hard for people to see that some of us have no one? When we say we have no friends, we literally mean we have none and don't talk to anyone all day? No one who cares? Family who doesnt bother, family that may even resent? When I see that 'reason to live', it makes me feel like theres another reason not to.. because I don't have anyone. No one would miss me. My mother acts as a carer and is the only person who would even noticed if I were gone, but if it werent for the fact that 'caring' for me so helps her further her political career, I would be out of luck. She's very much resents me, but uses me as a tool, to get votes. I've been in the papers against my wishes a few times because of this. Furthering her cause. Her lying about what she 'does for me'. I hate it. I'm currently sitting in a bed that hasnt been changed for 5 months, covered with rubbish, in a room filled with cobwebs. She doesnt let anyone in here. If the papers come, I'm ushered downstairs and my illness glamorised for her.

I do go on, don't I.. My point is, I can't enjoy the summer, or build snowmen. I can't see anything outside of these walls. I have no one. I'm not loved, and I have no one who wants my love either. I don't want to die, but I see no choice when the possibility of being happy is impossible for me. Because I'm here, and this is it.

I tried to make friends online. Every time, I'm just used. They start off sympathetic about my illness, then it always seems to turn into some morbid reason to use me.. because they know I'm isolated, they know I'm not going anywhere, so I'm just used until they have no use for me. Because I'm just broken worthlessness to them.

So many times that has happened. Used for advice, used for flirting, used for entertainment. All online. That trusty, faceless, online 'friend'. I cannot even see the possibility of meeting anyone who actually likes me, and who I actually can like and trust back, anymore. I just feel so exhausted and done. 

I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore, it feels like so much work just to be used and forgotten.

I did fall in love once. He used to visit me. I miss him with every part of me. It's been a very long time. I still dream about him at night when I dont want to. I can't even begin to describe how much I loved him.

Sometimes I imagine my last stand.. I'd make my way (albeit slowly) to a high bridge, just around the corner from me, that's over a river. And that would be it. The pain and the isolation, all over. All of this. It seems like the only choice.

And that's me.",depression

196688,"Life is shit and then you dieHey, hey everyone! I'm a 19-year-old girl and I've been suicidal for the past 5 years.


My first attempt at taking my life was this February, which ended up being unsuccessful. I got locked up in a psych ward for the second time, and let me tell you, I was pretty happy there. There were nice people, people I could openly talk to, and I quickly got close to them.


I'm generally not exactly your most sociable person, but since I have BPD, there's a side of me that is very outgoing and fun. But I still have no friends. The people from the psych ward cut me off. I don't know why nobody wants to be my friend. I think I'm a good friend. One that cares a lot for others.


Me being friendless isn't my only issue. I'm constantly stressed out because of school and have bad anxiety. I feel everything too deeply. It's a curse, really. I sometimes ask myself, ""Is it worth it to keep on living when I suffer so much on a daily basis?"" The answer is no. I don't think so. I'll try to end all of this again soon. Alone. Friendless. 


My fellow Redditors, nobody cared about me after I tried to kill myself. My mom was angry for like three days, she cried a bit, but whenever I tell her I'm feeling suicidal, she doesn't take it seriously. My teachers kind of avoid me, but not one of them has asked if I'm okay after I returned to school even though they knew all about it. Kind of heartbreaking, isn't it?

I don’t know what I’m hoping to accomplish posting this but I’m just hoping somebody can at least see it.

I feel like I am completely falling apart, and at the same time I feel so stupid for feeling that way. Everything that has happened is my fault, my entire situation is my fault.

I don’t think my mind has ever felt normal, my family has a long history of depression but I always thought it could never happen to me so I pushed any dark thoughts far away.

My head feels like it’s imploding every second of the day and it’s getting worse, I still live at home and Im so torn because all I want to do is get out but I’m so scared of being alone with myself. I feel so trapped all of the time but I’m also scared to be alone. I miss my girlfriend so much, I left her and it was a mistake but I shouldn’t go back on it, I left her for the most selfish reasons because I’m a cunt.

Im so sick of people telling me how well I’ve done already when I feel like a complete and total failure. I never feel like I’m going to get to where I want to be in life because I don’t even know where that is. I’m fucked financially I have debts that terrify me and I don’t know what to do about them. I know of all the proactive things that I should do but instead I just drink and distract myself with my head in the sand.

All of that is why I feel so fucking stupid, I’m not doing anything to help myself because I don’t deserve it, I put myself in this situation so why shouldn’t I suffer.

16466,"documentingJust trying to document this. I don't know.

-Recurring, repeating thoughts of ""i want to die"" and ""kill me"" over and over in my head for months. six months plus. I say these things out loud when I'm alone. google says that this isn't intrusive thoughts any more but suicidal ideation. I am working on a bank reconciliation and thinking I want to die. I am feeding my cat and wanting to die. i am out with friends and want to die. I am driving home from work and want to die. I am making a property repair and want to die. I am beating my fiance at videogames and wanting to die. Always in the back of my mind, kill me kill me kill me kill me.

-I had a plan. I moved house and now my plan wouldn't work. I've tried not to make a new plan.

-No one I've tried to talk to has understood. I think my grandma deliberately misheard when I said I was depressed, and said ""of course you're stressed"". The lady on the suicide line was really dismissive (""why would you want to live in a country that deported you?""). My fiance knows a little and is worried but I don't want to hurt him by telling him everything. Doctor just wants me in and out of her office as fast as possible. Trying to take my meds every day but they're not enough any more. If I told my mom I would just have to support *her* feeling bad about it.

-Sleeping about 4-6 hours a night. Working 40 hours a week at my day job. 20 hours or so at my business. 10 hours on political stuff. Phone with fiance 6-10 hours. More successful than any of my friends. Want to die the whole time.

-showering 3-4 times a week. brushing my teeth maybe every other day. mostly eating free bagels from work, microwave meals, pre packaged smoothies/protein shakes. self care is getting hard.

-need to put the cat in a kennel beforehand so she doesn't eat my face, lol

253015,"Circling the DrainSo now I'm down to one or maybe two months left to find work or get tossed out of my apartment.

I check regularly for jobs that are well suited to me and apply when I can. My resume looks kickass and my cover letters are generally very well written. I've gotten good feedback from people about them.

I am lonely as shit too. No close friends left. Women aren't really interested in me. There's always some little detail that isn't perfect and they just exit stage left. Maybe slowly, maybe politely, but who are they kidding.

Who ever said exercise if a cure for depression is an asshole. If I could exercise my woes away then I certainly wouldn't be here venting. This shit is just stabbing me in the chest from the inside.

To make matters worse, my sleeping problem is acting up again and I'm currently waking up in the afternoon. Setting my alarm earlier is pointless because I wake up, turn it off, feel shitty, so I roll back over and escape the shitty feeling with sleep.

I hate it when people look down their noses at me because I am not close with my family, meanwhile they have great families that treat them like a person. I don't talk to mine anymore because they never acknowledged me as an individual with my own personality, instead of just an extension of who they were.

I hate that I have to eat everyday, even when I really don't feel like it. When I don't I just end up feeling worse. I hate having to shower everyday, even when I've done nothing but sit in a chair or lie in bed. I hate that I live in a world that expects me to have to drive a car and I am bless with the good fortune to have anxiety attacks whenever I am in a car, even as a passenger. Yeah, no thanks.

I wish I had the energy to act out violently so I could vent all this rage I feel inside. Typing doesn't really do it for me.

I wish I could just turn myself off and die in my sleep. I think of all sorts of clever ways that I might be able to pull it off without having to resort to something painful. Like I don't feel bad enough already.

Fuck all these employers that want super hyper energetic enthusiastic outgoing people. How the fuck can I muster all that energy to put on a show when I can barely get up in the morning. Lucky me, coffee gives me migraines. I drink green tea all day and it doesn't seem to have any result on my energy level.

2:30am and I'm wide awake, pissed off, and worried that I'm not going to find work. What's worse is that every job I've ever had I was a better worker than everyone else around and got praised for it. Doesn't seem to amount to much of anything.

I don't know why I bother to keep trying. The only things I have left to look forward to are the next good movies or TV show. More escapes from a dreary reality.

197021,"I (21m) dont know how I can further improve from what ive already done
I am too ugly to date and it has been such a frustrating and demoralizing experience. I’ve done everything in my power to fix it, I’ve lost 80 pounds, I bought all new clothes, I bought a car, I’ve held a job down for over a year, I go to college, none of this even matters. I’m still so ugly that it just doesn’t make sense for any woman to settle for me when they can find anyone with the same traits as myself but aren’t repulsive.

I’ve been on tinder (paying for gold since March), bumble, okcupid, and hinge since October and between all of those apps I have around 10 matches combined between them and 0 dates. I’ve had my friends take pictures of me, help me write a bio, and I had my friends who are girls who are pretty experienced with dating apps look over my profiles, but none of that matters if you’re as ugly as me. I’ve asked out girls in person as well, the last three were people I would consider good friends of mine and they all three said yes. Not a single one of them showed up and not a single one of them told me beforehand that they weren’t coming, I’m not worth the effort I guess.

I’m very good with people, I have two different friend groups who invite me out to be the “funny guy”. I have lots of girls who are great friends with me but when I ask them out they want nothing to do with me. For example, I’ve asked three girls who were good friends with me in the last 6 or 7 months and they’ve all said yes, each time they’ve seemed very excited to go out with me but out of all of those times none of them even told me they weren’t coming, I’m not even worth knowing that you don’t want to see me, I’m worthless.

I don’t even have anyone I can turn to, even my mom and sister told me that despite losing 80 pounds that I’m still a 2/10. What else am I supposed to do at this point? I’d get plastic surgery but I’ll never be able to afford it. I just feel like my only purpose is to be an inconvenience to women who are looking for men who aren’t subhuman vermin. I don’t even have a career to look forward to because I decided that it would be a good idea to take on lifelong debt for a fucking history degree. It feels like I have nothing to look forward to, poverty? Being alone forever?

95357,"I've given up on my dreamsI got diagnosed with bipolar type two a little while back, the medication is supposed to take the edge off but it hasn't. I'm still anxiety filled and a nervous wreck around people. I'm still as suicidal as I was before.

I have a retail job that gives me no pleasure due to how critical I am of myself. Every little mistake I make is loud in my head.

I wanted to be a Youtuber since I was 12, since this damn depression hit me like a train and I found comfort there. I still do. I'm 19 now. 

I'm hurts knowing I could never be that. That I could never shake hands or be friends with people I consider role models, that I can not make people happy. 

I decided to lower myself and try and become a biographer, and I couldn't even get through a semester of college without a complete melt down and an abusive relationship.

And now I'm on the path of becoming a truck driver, because of my love of traveling. 

But I keep thinking that it isn't what I want to become. Yes I love to travel but this huge part of me wants to make videos, but I cannot because I am scum.

I have no humor and I'm ugly as balls and I am just human waste. I have no friends become I alienated everyone around me because I haven't been happy in years. 

Typically when I feel like this it passes for after a few hours but this has been stuck with me for awhile. I know how to die. I know what notes to leave behind. I have nothing to fucking lose other than my cat.

I keep feeling that I need perfection. Perfect body, perfect mind, perfect people around me - it's not gonna happen. Figures.
But it's more than that - I keep wanting hope, at least, for something better, like love, beauty, things like that. But I know that there's nothing like that that's the way I'd like it. Everything is done so we get something pleasing, no difference between one night stand and a love of our lives. Everything we do is for the sake of ourselvess, and it's something I can't accept. I want to have all of this, but pure, not for me, or some other kind of pleasure, but just... I don't know, the way you could think of love after watching a movie. Without this meaninglessness, and egoism, and just as good as we all want it to be. But it doesn't work like that.
I should just get over it and take it all as it is. I know that. But I'd rather off myself than go through life that is so broken, not just for me, but for everyone, and I think I will.

126532,"I'm Tired And LostTo put it simply, I've been in and out of therapy for over 20 years. Basically since I was in high school. I've been put on a variety of meds with little to no real improvements. My current therapist is a wonderful person and she truly means well. Our discussions are always insightful, but I still feel like after all these years, no real ground is being made. I'm tired. I'm at my wits end trying to figure things out. I can't even get a straight diagnosis. I have no idea what's wrong with me or if there even is something wrong with me and I can't afford to pay high priced specialist to figure it out. I'm here on Reddit with this because I'm so depressed and lost that I'm starting to feel like there's only one answer to my problems. 

Death.

I don't want to take my own life, but I feel like I've run out of options. I just want to know for certain what is wrong with me so I can finally start to move past it. Focus on fixing it or at the very least get the necessary treatment I need to get better. To do better. So I'm here, writing to the collective world of Reddit in hope that maybe someone out there has a definitive answer. I'm going to list out my symptoms and try to be as detailed as possible so please excuse me if this gets a little long.

Ever since I was a kid I've had this ""thing"". I isolate myself from others and pace the floor with an object in my hand and living in a fantasy world. The object has evolved over the years as well. Starting off as a little toy shovel I got from an old Burger King kids meal and over the past 20 years has been a pen. The pen has to be a certain way and it has to FEEL a certain way in my hand. I can't describe the feeling. It's just something that I've always felt. Over time the pen has been molded so it has a slight curvature to it. The cap is always off and jammed onto the bottom of the pen, exposing the writing end. There is no ink in the pen though as it has dried out over time. I never use this pen to write. Only for when I'm pacing. The pacing can go on for hours. Sometimes I do it for so long that my legs will get tired from all the walking and even then, I push myself through it until I simply cannot walk anymore. As a kid I used to imagine myself in this world, playing the hero and saving the day. As I've got older, the fantasy world has changed and evolved. I no longer see myself in the fantasy world. Just other people. No one specific. Made-up people. The fantasies have become the basis for many of the stories I write (whenever I can put myself in front of a computer long enough to actually write them). No one even knows I do this. I don't talk to anyone about it and get an intense feeling of embarrassment at the very idea of anyone walking in on me while I'm doing it.

The pen always stay in my left pocket and, despite being very right handed, I often keep it in my left hand. I've been doing this for so long that I've come to a point where I prefer being isolated from people. I get annoyed when people interrupt or want me to do things that require I go outside.

There is the obvious depression and massive anxiety of course. I start to panic over simple things or doing simple things. I can't even bring myself to go down a water slide with my kids despite there being no real danger. The water is shallow enough to stand up in at the end of the pool. But the second they ask me to go down it with them I start to shake and get massive butterflies in my stomach and I start to feel like I'm going to pass out.

I'm afraid of doing anything. I don't feel like I'm picking up on social cues the way I should be. To be clear, I'm much better with physical or visual cues. But verbal cues or people being vague with their intent, I never pick up on it until someone points it out to me (which has made my dating life a living hell as who knows how many women have been hitting on me and I was none-the-wiser).  When others are experiencing emotion, regardless of whether it is directed at me or not, my initial reaction is the run and hide. I essentially shut down as if I'm waiting for it to go away. I don't know how to react to people when they're upset or sad. I feel like I used to know, but somehow over the years it's like I've forgotten how to communicate with people. To top it all off, I often feel like the weight of everyone elses problems and emotions are resting on my shoulders. Like they're expecting a lot from me and I have no idea what to do or how to help them. But I can't get their issues out of my head either so I can't even focus on myself so I end up shutting the whole world out.

I can only stay focused on things for so long before the fantasy world starts taking over and diverting my attention. I can't truly focus on a conversation with people without my mind trying it's damnedest to drift away. I'm constantly self-sabotaging, trying to do things the ""right way"" only to fail at every corner. When I get a thought it my head it's next to impossible for me NOT to think about it. I have an extremely hard time letting things go even when I know I should. Even when I know I'm wrong. 

I get very fidgety. I have a thing where I play with my beard now to a point where my wrists and elbows have started to hurt and are generally uncomfortable daily. Sitting for any length of time takes getting really, really engaged in something in order to pull it off. 

I don't know what to do anymore and I'm getting tired of trying. I'm getting tired of seeking help only to not feel like it's going anywhere. I don't know what's wrong with me and I've never been given a definitive answer and it's killing me. I'm worried if I don't get answers I'll never be able to get a grip on my own life and I don't want to do anything to hurt myself or others. But I feel like I'm out of options.",depression
17750,"I Can't Do This AnymoreIn 2 hours the deadline for submitting outstanding work on my course will pass, meaning I automatically fail 3/4 of all the credits I've done this year. My tutors have been very nice and one of the two pieces of work was due in about a month and a half ago but had an indefinite extension, but that can't go beyond 5 (GMT) here. So I've totally fucked up.

I've been depressed since I was 8 and it's got worse every year - before I could at least do academics, now I just can't anymore. I ended up in hospital for a suicide attempt last year. I hate my life so much, and I know that only i can change it but I'm too fucking weak/lazy/whatever to do anything. I do a useless degree anyway and have no prospects of employment once I leave, I'm 22 and never had a job for fucks sake... and now I've fucked up my education, so I'm about £23000 in debt for that plus about 3/4 of that given by my parents that I've wasted.

Add to that a big problem with computer use (that I'm ashamed to admit because what kind of fucking loser ends up like that instead of something actually addictive like alcohol or drugs?) and I don't know where I am. It would be one thing if it was just me but I'm disappointing a lot of people including my family and boyfriend (who I love but we never have sex because I just don't ever feel like it)

271888,"I’m ugly it’s very distressing and I want relief from it the only way how...- [ ] I’m Male 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) long legs short torso  lanky slim body  framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin aged 30. When I was younger I was small faced in proportion to my body so it was fine. Now I’m older my head lols too big for my body. .And now more than ever I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it’s because I’m ugly. Every night getting drunk alone. I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help (a steward) . I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something . but other times it’s not easy on my mental health as sometimes ppl stare at me for longer than normal and not look away and it’s 99% girls who do this (no it’s not the good kind of stares I’m 100% sure)  one night one girl in a queue stared at me facially then grimaced me down and she was like 4ft. , I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking with a disgusted look on his face. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I’m ugly (I once overheard him refer to me as a ‘creature’ to his friend) he stares at every shift and he’s nothing special either but when he’s when he’s talked to me he’s seemed nice and friendly with me. I now have to wear a beanie and a snood to cover myself up and guess what? The stares stopped. Being stared down because I’m tall and slim happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder and now my face has gotten fat. I don’t ever wanna leave the house Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s what I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‘ewwwwww god no’ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho but was quick to judge? I mean cmon I leave the house for the first time in 3 months and then that happened 2 hours in to a shift? I mean cmon can I get a break. My dad said to me a few months ago ‘it bothers me that youv never had the love of a good woman, it’s a crying shame, it must bother you’ and I just shrugged and said ‘I’m too ugly’ which I am. I wake up every morning with suicidal thoughts crying and replaying the ppl calling me ugly over and over again in my head. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life as much as I want to because I’ll just get bullied and treated like shit. Especially by girls who can fraud their faces with makeup and won’t leave the house without it on but judge me because I’m ugly. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. I spend every birthday and Xmas alone and it’s because I’m ugly, whoever said personality matters more eh? And I’m sick and  tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally everytime. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s being a complete douche.  in the years around 2012-2015  I worked in a nice bar in a good posh area and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl I worked with had a crush on me and let me know. I was less ugly then. I was thinner and younger faced and now I don’t Leave the house and get very lonely. but she will be the only girl who will ever like me.",depression

Then plod through, working and talking, and gradually make up for the time I wasn't there. But before I get close to actually _enjoying_ life, I'll tip back into depression, and go through the cycle all over again.

It's boring, and it's exhausting, and I can't see any way out other than death. I'm 33 now; I've been doing this for almost 20 years. In the past I could (sometimes) believe in the possibility of change. Now I've been round the block enough times that I can't.

We set our appointment and I gave her my history so she would know a bit before our first appointment. It was supposed to be at 6:30 today. About an hour after I sent the email she replies that she replies, ""After reviewing your response, I feel that I may not be the most appropriate counselor for you to begin working with.
 
It would not be ethical for me to work with any client that I feel is outside my scope of practice and experience. This is strongly emphasized in my profession and when this occurs, as it has before, I am to provide referrals to these individuals whose presenting concerns are outside the counselor's ability/expertise.""

I would understand if she was just out of school or something, but she isn't. I picked her because of her experience.

Okay, so I'm 16 and my life is a complete shit right now... I mean it has never been easy but this is just something I cant bare. Everyday seems the same and I can't see any point in this pathetic existence anymore. I was that happy, clown kid once that would make people at school smile and laugh, yet when I was going home, that's when the shit was getting dark. My house was that old, creepy, sleazy building always surrounded by weird people, and the school was my salvation. Always when I arrived home my mom would ask me about math homework. The beginning of my adventure with mathematics was pretty fun, I didn't have any problems, everything was so smooth but when the first problems appeared. Well, my mother would just sit with me for 3-4 hours straight, beat me, yell at me every single time when it was ""the mathematics time"" - we both knew it doesn't work, I'm not learning anything and it's not helping me even a bit but I guess she was doing that to release her pain. Other family members would just leave my room and go watch TV or something - they just didn't care. Back when I lived in that weird hotel-like building I would just run away to a toilet (it was located in a hallway) so you had to leave your apartment to actually reach it. I would just sit there and pray to god, ask him to kill me, to relief the pain. And shit I was only like what? 8? It was going like that for somewhere around 2 years, I don't remember. We moved to another place, my mom stopped doing ""that"", I couldn't meet my friends due to a considerable distance and my mom's regime. And to be honest I've started realizing that they were not my friends. I had a pretty strong bond with one guy in particular, we called ourselves brothers and that kind of bullshit. But we were not in the same class anymore, my so called friends found another clown to be friend with, they didn't need me cause I've changed, I've started being shy, didn't want to talk to anyone, I mean I've always been but not to that stage. And yea I lost all of my friends and ironically the only friend I have left is a guy we bullied. And then my depression, mood swings and family problems kicked in. To make a long story short, I barely know my father - he works abroad and I see him as someone completely random, sometimes I feel disgusted when I think about him even tho he is a hard working, loving guy I suppose(I'm a monster, I know that), my mother wants a divorce and my brother was trying make some money on my parents by exposing some uncomfortable things to another half. I haven't talked to him for 2 years now. Mood swings is a good one - Some days I just feel like I can get up, brush away the dust and move forward and I just work out, sing, dance all kinds of stuff and somedays I just feel like killing myself. The only thing preventing me from doing that is my cowardness and dream of a more heroic death. I would rather be deployed in combat and die thinking I saved someone's life instead of just killing myself but I dont for how long I can stay sane. I've tried talking to specialist and all it gave me was remorse, thoughts that I shouldn't be making any confessions. Now I'm in my new school, things are even worse, I have no one, literally no one to talk to and I dont let anyone talk to me. My school is a nightmare, my home looks like a wasteland after apocalypse and that's a pretty accurate metaphor if I do say so myself. I'm missing many days in school, my grades went to shit, hell I might get kicked out and I just want to kill myself. All I dream about is moving to US(Texas to be exact), earning GED, getting a decent job and living peacuful life till the end. Which is even more depressing when I think about the chances of this actually happening.

147456,"""I never thought I'd end up this way. I never thought I'd fall so far away.""
Well...I was asked to make a throwaway and post something here a few days ago...suppose I should.  Just to start off, I am fine now.  However, last weekend I was a bit fed up and just had a lot of stuff hit me at once...and, started wanting out.

In order to get the story, we have to go back...

For about five years now, I have been dealing with the dating world....The longest relationship I have had (2 years) was coming to an end, and I knew it..but wouldn't admit it..was clinging to it...didn't know anything else.  Since then I have dated girls for, oh...a month or two...before they end up cheating, or they just get to be too much too fast.  Two years ago I was working at a local gas station, made a friend of one of the employees, and my life started to change.  Up to this point I had always pretty much been a loner, the ""shy guy""...with this new friend I would do pretty much everything. I would stay there every weekend (we ended up going to another job, working four tens) and we would get drunk as hell.  I loved it, but I hated it....I finally got out of that, and had a falling out with him...then met two other friends...started a band, as I love music, and life was good...wasn't worried so much about dating.....now one has a kid on the way, the other works weird shifts....so back to being a loner....except this time, it is more or less because I hate people.  I have been talking to a girl I met online (not a dating site or anything, just a site similar to facebook)...it turned into more than a freindship, and for the past month we have had plans every weekend.......however, something always comes up and I don't find out until too late....I kinda gave up, and started talking to someone else...she found out, and flipped....now she is pulling the same crap...less talking, blah blah blah...I already know nothing is coming of this.

That is what sparked the feeling/thought.  But essentially, the reasoning is that I really do not see a point in making myself miserable because people in this world are cold, hell...it is making me cold....but coupled with that is the fact that I see the more and more retarded people, milking off people like me who work their ass off for a living....I honestly think economic collapse is coming..and am starting to hope for it....but last weekend I didn't care...I see my dreams falling apart, and I didnt know what to do..was just overwhelmed.  Then I realized, I dont need this shit...The whole reason I am often ""passed up"" is because of my mindset: Don't like a guy with long hair? Don't like my tattoo? Don't like my music? Fuck off, stop judging me. (not assaulting anyone, just trying to tell the story)....Basically, I need to stop with the self pity, and be me..if someone doesn't like it..why do I want to know them?


Anyway..I'll comment if anyone wants elaboration..just wanted to get it off my chest...trying to be more outspoken and stop holding that stuff in.",depression

I don’t know why but he always chooses us to cuss and loves the others more. He made fun of my brother for painting his nails. He calls him horrible names and used to say that he wasn’t his son.

I cut my hair before and he made fun of me and told me I look like a dy*ke. (Nothing wrong with being lesbian but he was being a homophobic ass). My mom always makes me feel better and it sounds lame but she’s truly my best friend. I love her more than myself and I couldn’t live without her. She’s my everything. I can’t imagine the day something happens to her. I’ve even thought about killing myself before anything happens to her just so I don’t have to see her like that. But I don’t want to hurt her. That would tear her apart and she’s lost so much. She deserves better than that. I don’t want to do that to my brother and sisters or even to my dogs. They don’t deserve that.

331413,"...help?I am really fighting the urge to either go ahead and kill myself or to just leave. I've given at an honest effort the past few weeks to exercise, think positively etc. and it's not doing jack shit. I just don't see the point to put in an effort anymore and I'm about two seconds away from draining my bank accounts (which is a very minimal amount) and just driving to wherever I end up and just forget the world for as long as possible. I'm sure I would wander back home eventually but who knows when.
Also, I can't get my suicidal thoughts out of my head and it is really tempting to follow through with it at this point. I have it planned out perfectly for hundreds of situations so that I will actually reach my goal next time and not scar any family members. I just don't know what to do.
I will be on for at least the next 5 hours so AMA or give advice please.

I could do anything to fix my life. Set goals, Find hobbies, look for joy in everyday things, not do reckless behavior but yet I couldn’t see past myself.

They’ve recently put me on some kind of antidepressant weeks ago. I missed my appointment and I don’t know if I want to go through all this I feel like I’d rather die because how am I. Could i ever stay in touch with the world, myself, others. Am i just born like this Is this my true me? Can I feel and think like a person?
Most people have it so lucky in their life. They won't know what it's like walking day to day mindlessly. What it's like to switch from one dream to the next and have it crushed 2 seconds later. What it's like to day to day end up starving yourself because you're too tired to make a meal or wash dishes. Days become months. Everything feels pointless and no matter how much you try you don't have dreams, even things like living in a nice house, enjoying relationships, wanting to win something doesn't matter.

It’s like being locked away where you can’t even heir yourself. The cloud analogy fits. I was so confused that I didn’t even see myself. My emotions were gone. I can’t tell anyone what’s inside. I can’t see myself when I’m like that. No one can help me wen I'm like that.

To say I want to kill myself for feels like I’m saying this to open up to talk to someone but I do feel at some points that I am doomed to a fate which I dread or I simply don’t see meaning to live.
I feel like i was born different. All my life I’ve felt wrong and I’ve never felt like anyone could understand me. I was never human. If I killed myself I’d not have to go back to that dark place and all the misunderstandings. other people will see I suffered and then move on in time. I don't want to hurt them. In fact i wished they didn't care so it make it easier. I still live because where i'm at now if i left it hurt them the most.

I won’t have to face fate taking over me and robbing me of my worth (this is most important to me even when I can’t see it I still feel a sense of loss).

I want it before the cloud comes back. I feel it coming back and then I my be back back to being a walking shadow bound to mindless suffering.",depression

I don't know how to quantify how many times I have ""attempted"" taking my life. As a teenager I planned it out, wrote the notes, and then just stared at the blades and decided not to do it because I didn't want to hurt people. Since then I just make a lot of stupid decisions not caring if I will end up surviving - self harm - eating disorders - not wearing my seat belt in cars - mixing pills and booze - taking sleeping pills before I take baths... it can calm me down knowing that I might not survive something but that I am not *actively* making that choice. 

A few years ago I survived my only serious attempt. I survived my overdose and a friend had to take care of me for a few days but she never asked what had happened to me. I never told my family or went to the doctor. I never had that moment of joy that I survived, I just felt stuck and kept on with the ""fake it until you make it"" and that's mostly what I have been doing since. Over the past few years I have told a few of my closest friends what I had done, but it is obviously not something I wear publicly. Even my bf about of about 2 years does not know; its not just something I can express because I don't think anyone understands. I am in counseling, and my counselor knows - but talking about it doesn't seem to help. 

A friend of a friend took her life this week and I was *jealous*. I felt so dirty admitting that to myself but I was/am. I survived my suicide attempt and a major car crash and associated rehabilitation - two events that are supposed to make you appreciate life - and yet I am bummed I survived. And every time someone around me is dealing with the fallout of losing someone they love - they are angry and don't understand and I feel so alone and alienated because I DO. People rant about how selfish suicide is - but how is it not selfish to expect people to exist when they are in so much pain? It's so lonely knowing that no one will ever understand. And that just because I don't see a future for myself doesn't meant that I don't love and enjoy everyone around me. 

I don't see myself taking my life in the near future, but that is mostly only me existing for my dog. I fantasize about it a lot.

I grew up in a very strict religious home. My father was a baptist pastor and I “accepted Christ” at 5 or 6. Whether I fully understood it, I don’t know. But I do know that as I grew older I always felt like a “bad Christian” and a let down, especially as i explored sexuality. Basically my preteen and teenage years were a combination of a pure fear of death and a utter guilt of my sexuality. 

As time grew on, I became addict to porn and masturbation. Which ad life developed and time took its toll; my mother died at the age of 21 and  I found solace in porn, bdsm, and fetish. Which did not align with my spiritual beliefs. 

To compound on top of my mothers unexpected death, I dealt with I now realize as being serve depression as a teenager, beginning with my first break up at 16. I used to play with my fathers loaded revolver and lay in bed and imagine writing my note. 

As I progressed into my twenties my porn “addiction” or dependency increase so did my guilt and shame. I eventually lost my virginity at 22, the ultimate black mark as a Christian, or so I perceived it. 

Depression still sever. I fucked as many women as possible. I was in therapy and SA (an anonymous 12 step) several times with no relief. I found the most wonderful and beautiful woman I have ever met to this day, I still day dream about her. She Broke my heart after 4 months of dating and preparing for engagement  and left me for her ex-husband, she was only 24 at the time. 

Time passed, I stayed depressed, thought I might have been gay/trans and my therapist diagnosed me as a sex addict as a 14 on a scale of 20. Lots of money spent on chats and p2p sites. 

In 2018 I met a girl on a hook up, and I thought she was my savior. I professed love within 3 weeks. We were engaged yesterday.  But yet I was online chatting and sexting women today. And trans women a month ago. 

I’m so depressed. I feel as if I’m an awful person. A despicable person, an atrocious Christian, and a shame of lover/fiancé. There’s been days leading up to the engagement, I’ve just wanted to leave her, but we moved a thousand miles away from where we lived to be close to her family, and I feel I’m in too deep now to do anything  but marry her. But there’s fucking shit that drives me insane about her.

No referral or even a point to where I am suppose to go for help. I'm researching my new city but it looks bleak; months long waiting lists just for intakes. I give up. I can't do it again and be treated like a piece of garbage that is just in the way. I reached out before and nothing has really changed in those three years .

340828,"How to help my family and close friends deal with my suicide?Strange tittle question perhaps but I made this agreement with myself some time ago. As the days go by I know I'm reaching the point where I will be leaving this world through my own means, and for my own private reasons. 
I'm not necessarily against telling these people outright my plans, however detailed they wish them to be described, but the situation I would like to avoid is making them feel (even more than if I had said nothing) that they could have some how prevented this decision. 
I have kept a diary for the last 6 or so months for my thoughts and feelings, purposefully written in a format designed to be read by others. This was really going to be my suicide note as such. My greatest difficulty is trying to lessen the anguish as much as possible for those that I ultimately burden for the rest of their lives a traumatizing event they will surely feel they could have prevented and absolutely will not have expected in any way shape of form.
I appreciate all advice in advance and hope I have broken no forum rules. Regards, Tom.",depression

93305,"I want to end it so badI originally had a suicide date planned for 4 years from now. Come to think of it, it will probably happen much sooner than that. I’m barely through the first semester of freshman year and I already abhor college with every fiber of my being. I am not interested in any of the classes I am taking and no career path sounds interesting for me at all. It seems like the future is setup for me to work a job I’ll absolutely hate and have no place in. The only thing I remotely enjoy nowadays is watching my favorite streamer on twitch. As sad and pathetic as this sounds, it seems like my only escape from reality, suicidal thoughts, school, and life in general. I still live with my parents and I am extremely scared of changing my major. My parents will be very angry at me if I decide to switch from nursing to something else. They don’t understand my depression and suicidal thoughts either. Last year I was very desperate for emotional support and I told them about how I have been feeling. I was yelled at and lectured by them about how I shouldn’t be feeling the way I feel and that I am lucky to live in a first world country with running water, power, electricity, and a roof over my head. My parents were from a third world country and they moved to america when I was a baby, to give some context to my situation. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. My parents worked for their entire lives to bring me to america. I feel like a spoiled piece of shit compared to the struggles they’ve been through to go to the US. I feel so much pressure on my shoulders to be “successful” in my academics and my future career. I am slowly but surely losing my motivation and will to live.

298456,"No one will probably bother to read this, anyway.My fiancée just got admitted to the inpatient psych department in the local hospital for the second time for anorexia nervosa. She developed it due to my rage disorder along with the stresses of medical school, but I'm certain it was me that caused the disorder to manifest. She's always been high strung, but never at a point where her brain developed a disorder that resulted in regular self harm (which for her causes a sense of euphoria, but that's a separate discussion over the nature of eating disorders). It was my rage issues that resulted in me flipping the mattresses with her on the bed flinging her against the wall. It was my rage that caused me to lash out at her unnecessarily time and time again. I've been in therapy for the past year and 4 months and on an SSRI that has been quite beneficial, and have since gained a lot of useful insight into my triggers and how to prevent them, but the damage I've done won't go away. I'm currently sitting in our condo (which her parents paid for so that she could go to medical school) alone, drinking myself into a stupor bawling my eyes out and wishing for nothing but to erase everything I've ever done to everyone I've ever known. I want to stop being a burden to those closest to me, but everything just seems so futile.

I tried to quit pot for a while but I became so overwhelmingly depressed that I couldn't function at all anymore. I smoke way too many cigarettes and can't quit. I'm so traumatized that I literally can't go anywhere or do anything without getting insanely paranoid. Like to the point where I feel like I'm going to freak out. ALL THE TIME. EVEN WHEN I LOOK FUCKING FINE. I literally cannot see the point in living my piece of shit life any longer. I hate fucking working for my dad and he's told me multiple times that he doesn't want me to do that. But every time I try to do something, shit seems to get fucked up. Lots of girls like me but I'm too paranoid and crazy to talk to any of them and none of them will come talk to me. I really like this one girl but I have no idea what happened to her and no one will till me and it drives me fucking insane. About the only thing I can even stand anymore is drinking and smoking pot, and visiting prostitutes occasionally, which was extremely unpleasant last time. I basically hate everything about my piece of shit life. A lot of my friends humiliate me and I just want them to know that I forgive them and I'm not going to do anything if they'll just stop messing with me. And they won't even tell me what's going on, which is fine as long as it stops. I really don't care anymore. I feel like I have absolutely no reason to live and I just want to die pretty much all the time. I don't want to get with any girls but this one girl, if I could just see her. I liked her and I am completely committed to monogamy. But I don't know what happened to her and I feel like I'd just want to die if I couldn't see her. My whole shitty life is pointless. So who gives a fuck what I do right? All I want is to see this one girl, to have some fucking friends I can trust and then sort my life out. That's it. I literally don't see the point in doing anything til that happens but I'm going to try again. Like I've tried OVER AND OVER again in the past. But shit kept getting fucked up in coincidental ways. I used to be so fucking kind and trustworthy and funny and generous and now I just feel like the worlds biggest asshole because I say dumb shit. All because I can't see one girl, and I don't want any other girls. I guess I just have to hope that she'll find her way back to me.",depression
227660,"Massive rant about a nice guy and the most awkward guy I knew This happened around January to March (When quaratine started). Let me set the scene, I'm a 16 year old girl, but I look like I'm 12 becuase I'm 4'11 (about 150 cms), I have some close friends, but not many.

I had known this kid in my history class for a while, he's your stereotypical dorky kid, a little awkward, but probably just a phase. He's also rather short (around 5'2 I think), he's also a freshman and 15 years old. Fast forward to January when I catch feelings for this boy (Probably since he gave me any kind of positive attention without blowing off my rude exterior). 

I tell my friends, and they want to meet him. I invited him to my friend group, where he ended up getting along extremely well. We all thought this would be a one time thing, however he keeps showing up; We don't really care, we just wonder where his friend group is. One day I'm texting him and this question pops up, he tells me he isn't that close to his friend group, and that's why he's with us. I don't think much of it, since he was kinda awkward and more feminine than other guys. I want him to play this game I really like, which he barely plays any of, and he tells me it's cause he's busy. (I realized he was lying and just didn't like the genre of the game, but I kept quiet)

Fast forward a few weeks, I'm hanging out with one of my other friends at the mall, getting ready to go to her house to play video games. I get a text from my crush, she asks me what I want from this. I tell her I don't really care when he finds out, I'm just too scared to say so myself. (I'm someone who gets over crushes very easily once I've been rejected, then I get another crush months to a year later) She and I decide that it would be better for her to just tell him I like him, because I want to be able to get over this as soon as possible.

Next week he's texting me every day, sometimes kinda creepy good morning texts, same time every day. Next thing I know he's also completed the game I asked him to play in a weekend. I ask him what he thought about it, exticed to have someone to talk about it to. I then quickly realize talking to him, he took the most minimal route to beat the game, missing out on more than half the game. I asked him why he would take the shortest way. He then turns on me to say that he took out a massive chunk of his weekend for this, and how stressed he felt from all his work, and that it was my fault he was feeling like that. 

It didn't take me long after to realize why he played the game, he didn't have a change of heart, he just wanted me to like him more. I soon then learn why he isn't connected to his friend group that much. He tells me, ""even though I help people with their problems, right after they ditch me"". By this point I'd realized, he's a nice guy. Somehow it got worse, between this revelation he'd told my other friend that he'd caught feelings for me, only after learning I might be into him. He also told her that the other reason he liked me, was becuase I was one of the few people shorter than him.

I end up trying to appear like I'm not into him, when I'm around my friend group, I talk about which video game characters I think are the cutest/hottest, which girls in the school I think are cute (I'm bi if you couldn't guess). One day, I'm feeling sick so I stay home and go to sleep earlier. I wake up in the morning to him confessing his feelings to me and annoyingly asking why I hadn't responded. I end up telling him that I'm just not into him, not telling him the anymore part of it. 

My friend group expect him to end up leaving, since I had rejected  him. Nope. He then got a crush on one of my friends becuase he saw her as ""easier"", she's not outspoken in any situation and comes off as very soft to people who don't know her that well. She wasn't into him because of how quickly he jumped ship from me to her. At this point he then starts to insert himself into any situation he can.

When my friends all planned to hang out and play Don't Starve Together, he asked to go along. We all said yes to not hurt his feelings, when we do meet up, all he does is play music and games on his phone. When we got bored of the game, me and him then played Pokemon Showdown together, I end up sweeping the floor with him multiple times. Rather than making a joke or anything, he then claims he kept on miss clicking, and had bad luck.

Eventually, he tells my friend he like her, she rejects him, only to still hang around us for no apparent reason. At this point we've all realized he's only tried to get along with all of us to get in me and my friend's pants. We try to distance ourselves from him by only talking about stuff he can't butt into. It doesnt work. He finally picked up on it when we started to take refuge in a classroom, after we told him that he might be along better with people in his grade.

My husband has been very patient with my mood changes and depression. He takes care of many things around the house. He has cooked food for us almost everyday since the quarantine started. My family is on the other side of the continent. My husband has a way of dealing with feeling I don’t fully understand . He is quite reserved with his worries. It makes me admire him in a way, but also feel a bit more toxic when I voice my negative thoughts. I feel very guilty about the harm it will do to him and my mother. I have no sense of purpose and basically I feel like I created hell in my self, since I dislike myself in a very deep way. I also live in constant pain. How can I make this with them suffering as little as possible?",depression

Constantly upset about not having money but refuses to work, forces me to get a job at 21 weeks pregnant and he is basically an absentee parent to our son. I just don’t have the money to divorce. So I just fantasize about killing myself everyday. I feel like death is the only option to give me any peace",depression

One of the worst parts is that there has not been ONE SINGLE DAY since then where I have felt glad that I did not succeed.  It has been nothing but a dark, painful, miserable journey.  All I ask for mow is the guts to go through with it and get it over with.

76105,"Type 1 Diabetic and wanting to die.So yeah in the title it kinda says what I am. I've been trying to off myself ever since I was a little tyke back in middle school but to no avail. I've kinda just sat back never really talking to anyone but using videogames as sort of a vent to make myself feel like something. Being good at a game or becoming immersed is what helped me get through a lot of things. I've just felt that sitting around building up medical costs has been dragging me down super hard. I've never had a job or anything to make money because I always get super nervous when I walk into interviews and I beat myself up for it all the time. I should already be out of my mom's house out on my own, but I don't have a car nor can I drive. So I can't really drive to a job or go to college and I'm pretty sure I'd become a nervous wreck anyways. I've also never really taken care of myself for my diabetes, which has made me become incredibly aware that my body will probably start to break down on me very early before any of the few friends I have start to go. I don't know, just being a ""useless loser"" as I put it makes me not want to be around as I feel like I waste the money, time, space, and food of everyone around me. It also doesn't help that I never talked to anyone who I'd want to be in a relationship with. I'm gay and would really just like someone to stop and care for me, but I know that sooner or later they would be fed up with how useless I am. Anyways I've been contemplating whether or not I should off myself out where I am now; at some farm in the middle of nowhere. My mom decided she wanted to move in with here boyfriend in the middle of nowhere and since I had no one who wanted to take me in I had to go. Now I sit here typing this alone. I'm pretty sure they both realize how useless I am and I'm not sure what they'll do about me. It really just helps me to type this and ask for people to shoot the breeze with since the internet is so bad out here I can't talk to my friends or play any games to help me relax and vent. It just seems like my whole life will be like this and there's no escape. I mean I've though of just up and leaving one day and walking and just going until I decide to stop but I just don't know. Doesn't really help me either knowing that 3 months ago I tried to OD on insulin and woke up in the hospital and now I've got like $2000 in medical bills straight out of highschool with no way to pay them. I'm sorry if this is too long but I'm just confused and not sure what to do and it really helps to vent this because the only people who've known my motivations were my couple closest friends.",depression

109171,"My (hopefully) last true confession. Understand my reasoning. No false hope.

Camp, the 5 suicides or more I almost caused, the almost death of me and my father, the amount of friendships fucked from me. The emptiness for human contact, the lack of confidence and self esteem is fucked. 

I fucked everything I loved but I got the people out of the certain shit life or helped them the best I could, they are happy, I will never be. It’s hard to imagine this past decade has just been a game of survival and not living.

Every broken heart, every thing I hurt because of me, I deserve all the shit I get. If anyone deserves to live it sure as hell ain’t me. 

If anyone close to me or personally knows me reads this, I’m sorry. I’m self isolating and I want to leave. Just plain want to die. I hate living, it ain’t right for me. I want to be happy but I want to die, I want a girlfriend to love but I can’t be happy. What is there left for me? Nothing. Don’t give false hope, understand my reasoning. No more explanations, just this. I feel like 2 different people and I need to escape this cycle.

6 years ago tried to hang myself. Spent a month in the psych ward and 6 months on mind-numbing pills. 

3 years ago a roommate stole $4000, all I had, from me. 

Last week I was in a car accident. I was not at fault. An 18-wheeler read ended me. 

Today I found out that insurance is not going to repair my car, they are only going to give me the worth of the car, and since it's a 2007 that amounts to $FuckAll. 

My car is scrap and now I've got nothing left. Literally nothing left. It's all gone. I can't afford another car and I can't do anything with the measly fifteen hundred dollars I'll get from that fucking cunts insurance. Fifteen hundred dollar. For my entire fucking livelyhood. That's all it was worth. That's all my life is worth. Nothing.

17919,"Pharmacist and Psych almost killed me - cautionary story.I finally submitted to the litany of people telling me to go on medication, so I was put on a combo of Resperidone and Wellbutrin to prevent my suicide that I desperately did NOT want to do. I would take these pills as directed (if you try them, then do it right), but 3 weeks in when I was having them filled out at the pharmacy, they ran out of my Wellbutrin due to a regional shortage!

The pharma called my Psychiatrist to see if I could take the x2 quick release ones instead, and they mutually agreed it would suffice until mine were available. They told me to take a double dose for the day I missed, but I double dosed a pill that is already double the strength....

That evening I was trying to eat ramen with my gf, and my soul shattered into a million pieces and I thought I instantly needed to kill myself - like right fucking now. The pain felt like a combo of my parents dying, being sentenced to prison, and being diagnosed with HIV and paralysis, all at once. I fell into a fetal position crying with snot and spit all over my face, in a restaurant. 

If my gf didn't drive me, I would have driven my car into a building at 150km/h to die, or slit my wrists in the tub. I thought of suicide-by-cop as well.... Anything. 

The hospital was disgusted by the incompetence of the pharma and psych, and their now under investigation. My arms are sliced open from cutting, and a year and half later, I'm getting my scars covered with tattoos tomorrow.

TLDR, take pills if you have run out of options - they've saved millions of lives. But 
only if you trust your doctors and always stand up for yourself if you're skeptical. A wrong combo can be fatal if you're not around an immediate support system like I was. Don't be ashamed or hide your pain, tell the world and help WILL find you eventually.",depression

337902,"i was forced to go off my meds cold turkey and now my mood swings are way stronger than they ever have beennumerous adult figures in my life (including my acupuncturist, which i will address later) have tried to convince me to go off my meds (sertraline 75mg), mostly because of the anti-western medicine mindset they have (old fashioned east asian adults from the baby boomer era). i haven’t been taking them for that long, maybe like 3 months at most, and i hadn’t seen a noticeable difference yet so i wanted to continue to see how it went. i didn’t think it was improving my depression all that much but it definitely helped in keeping my mood stable. 

my moms main reason for wanting me off them was for the sake of my reproductive health (i’m an only child and a girl). i’m not exactly sure where she got the idea that sertraline would mess with my reproductive health as she never even bothered learning the name of the meds i was taking, so i tried to ignore her badgering me. she hid my meds at one point and it made me upset, which got her upset at me for taking them in the first place. 

my acupuncturist, also my moms friend, got really offended when i told her i take sertraline for some reason. she gave me an ultimatum: sertraline or acupuncture. this was all happening during my acupuncture session, as in while needles were stuck in my body, and i had to stay relaxed so i just complied to not cause any tension and to not fuck up my muscles. she told me later sertraline would interfere with the new meds she was planning to put me on, and that since i haven’t been on them for that long that i don’t have to taper off them or anything, so i agreed to go cold turkey.

it’s been less than a week and i feel like complete shit. my mood swings are at the worst they’ve ever been. i want to die every fucking day and i feel completely ignored and belittled. i just need someone to tell me i matter because i can’t convince myself of that right now ",depression

No matter what your problems are, not matter how old or young you are, what your race or gender is, how successful or fucked-up you are, suicide is always an option. Knowing that you could end your own life whenever you wanted is so comforting feeling.

Suicide is permanent solution, because death is permanent.

All problems are temporary, because life itself is temporary.


I don't see suicide as inherently bad. If I saw it that way, I would have to agree that death is also bad.

Death isn't inherently bad. Life isn't inherently good either.

It's just a natural order of things in the Universe.

Universe isn't good. Universe isn't bad or evil either.

Universe is just cold and uncaring infinity.

It's as though I'm stuck in a place where I try to better myself not for other people but to be a better me. Non of it matters though, no matter how hard I try to be the best me I can so that I am happy nothing changes.

Whether it be a gun, overdose, crashing into a object at speeds I know will end all the pain. I don't want to be here any longer and I'm not sure what to do anymore.

The sad thing is I know she loves me. And she isn't the reason I'm feeling this but I'm scared because how can someone I see as perfect see me as perfect aswell when all I see in myself is disgust and hate. I've never known how to love myself but I've been able to love others so much I get lost in what seems like an endless void. I'd do anything for so many people but can't do anything to help myself and it's the most terrifying thing I've experienced, there has been so much pain and sorrow in my life in the past and I've tried forgiving and moving on but daily I think of the past and the terrible things that have happened.

This is the first time I've said anything to people who aren't close to me, and even then I've only told a handful of people how I feel. No one seems to get it they just think it's their fault and they should have been able to see it.

I want it to stopI’m 22 and I have been on a 4 year “journey” with my therapist in finding out that I was actually verbally/emotionally abused VERY regularly by my mother growing up. She’s still overbearing to this day. I’m still in the mourning phase: I cry all the time. I feel so sad for myself as a child. She isolated me from my family so i can’t talk to any of them. 

I have a boyfriend that I’ve been dating for over a year but I’m not the same person I was when we met. I’m mourning that too. A good bit of trauma has happened to me over the course of my life and I haven’t dealt with any of it because I don’t know how to process my emotions. I’m very defensive and think everyone hates me. My boyfriend FOR SURE is getting real sick of me. I was supposed to be on new medication but my insurance sucks. All my friends left because they don’t want to deal with me anymore. 

I have NOBODY to talk to... ive tried posting on some subreddits here (this isn’t my main account) but it didn’t really work. I’m so tired and angry and sad and anxious all the time... this isn’t living. 

These past 5 months have genuinely been the WORST time of my entire 22 years of living but people just think I’m just being dramatic when I say that.

286762,"20, Male; Hating Myself: The Cycle of LifeI feel like my life is generally pretty alright (in a broad sense). I know that isn't typical of a person with thoughts of suicide, but maybe today is just one of my better days.

And having a decent life is also a part of why I want to end it some days, if that makes any sense. I'll try to explain.

When things do start to pile up and drag me down (which happens almost cyclically, though I haven't yet identified any trigger of sorts), I usually turn to other friends who have similar issues or I look online for help. What often happens is that I witness people feeling the same way that I do, only over much worse (I feel almost objectively) circumstances. It's then that I start to feel bad for feeling bad, y'know? ""His problems are so much harder and more painful than mine, yet here he is still,"" would be something I say to myself often. Then I start to feel like a villain, almost, because I'm contemplating suicide over what seem like trivial matters by comparison.

My point, I suppose, is that I have issues with seeing the good in my life and often feel very depressed over the bad. Then, when I am reminded of the good, I feel even worse for having let it go unnoticed and start to spiral further downward.

I'm not fully certain what I'm looking for. I'll gladly answer any questions about specific details if you think you can help with any of my problems.

For my basic problems, however:

* How can I better see the happiness in life and appreciate it more?
* If I am having troubles appreciating niceties, should I consider being tested for depression or something similar?
* Part of my sadness stems from receiving little to no results from my hard work and efforts (in a few different areas). Is this a sign I should give up or just keep fighting harder?

67734,"First and I don't want it to be my last postHey everyone, pardon me for my grammar, English is not my first language (rather 3rd). I'll try to give as much detail about me without giving my identity away. I have been on this site for quiet some time, yet only now I decided to make an account, because I feel like it's the time. I tried to kms, with the gun I've got when I was 9 years old (pneumatic Baikal rifle, looks similar to one of those biathlon once) for Ligo Diena. A celebration of Summer Solstice in my country. It jammed on me when I tried to end my life in the middle of November by shooting myself in the brain from the top of the mouth. After I pulled the trigger it took me a minute to collect my courage to open my eyes again to realize it's not over yet. I checked the gun and tried again. Same result. This already happened when I went on a shooting range and all the bullets started stacking inside without leaving the barrel properly. As of now I am 15, 16 in little over a week. I live in a family with above average income, yet a majority of my parent's income has vanished due to some of their ex-partners betraying him. We still don't live in poor conditions, yet the tensions in my family are ever rising. Couple of years ago I got in a conflict with my father where he didn't talk to anyone from my family for 2 months due to me resisting to throw the box from the 2014 World Cup finals football (not that into football, but it still looked neat to an eleven year old me). If you think I am not recalling the entire conflict and that would never happen, pardon me, but it did. A similar situation happened a couple years later, when my dad started to eat potatoes with his bare hands from my bowl after touching his toes and rubbing his itches all over his body. I waited for him to stop, and after the 3rd time he reached in I asked him if he wants me to go get him a separate bowl of the same potatoes. He said he is fine and continued on eating. Then he asked me if I want to go play golf with him and his coworker (sorry to all the golf fans, not my thing especially after he reached into my bowl for the 9th time with his dirty hands). I wouldn't mind this, I just left the kitchen after I putted everything away. I would've definitely forgot about it the next day, but he decided to boycott my family, but this time for nearly 3 months. A more recent situation that drained my will to live, happened in around may, after having a crush on someone for around 4 years I finally looked at another girl. That school year 6 girls had a crush on me from the grade below (I ain't completely ugly, yet I am definitely not a pretty boy, I rate myself 4/10, my friends tell me I am a 7). I still doubt that any of those girls liked me for my looks, but rather for my shitty jokes and ability to play guitar. I've liked one of them back. We were together for 2 and a half month of summer. She couldn't meet me in June, and in the end of June I got into another conflict with my father. We went on vacation to the coast of Mediterranean. He refused talk to me or my mother for 1 and a half month because I ""disrespected him"" by saying ""please don't touch me"" when he just got out of water and I was laying down on the towel while being on my phone texting my girlfriend. This put a lot of pressure on me which I undeservingly released on my gf. She broke up with me mid august, around same time after my dad has started talking to me again. Now I realized he never partook in raising me. He never took care of me as a child and now he wants to spend time with me when I needed that time years ago. I don't hold a grudge against him for that. But he yells at my mother for doing the simplest things such as cooking too much food. He is very ungrateful and doesn't understand how much she cares of him and the family and how little he gives back. When she asked him to listen to her, he said he is the one earning the money, he should be listened to and not her. As the result me and my mother had to live off for 30 euro for a month, that including food, hygiene products and other necessities. I had those 30 euro saved up in my piggy bank. Later on I got back with that girl around begging of November only to break up with her again in two weeks, cause I found out from others that she now only viewed me as a friend. More recently approaching the time when my grandma died in around Christmas time of 2017 from cancer, my grandpa also got into the hospital with possibility of the same type of cancer (in 2018). They haven't met each other for the past 35-40 years. As of now I feel like a depressed sack of shit, who gets emotionally overly attached to people, who can't move on, gets yelled on by his father (and when my mother tries to stand up for me she gets yelled at too. This happens vice versa too). I try my best to get good grades so I can leave this house and be able to sustain at least barebones living away from this place. For now the only things which relieves my inability to sleep is overdosing on ""valerijanka"" and writing songs. I am sorry if something doesn't make sense, I can clarify it if you ask me specifically. I had asthma for 4 years almost all primary school years which has left me, but gave me shaky hands and sweaty palms which makes it hard to type when I am nervous. The abuse from my father towards me and mother is getting to me. He demoralizes us both and makes us indirectly starve by giving no finances to buy simplest of food or hygiene products if we don't obey him. I don't blame my ex for leaving me. She really deserves better than this.",depression
337011,"I dodged a bullet. So it's like 6 AM where I'm at and I figured I'd share a story. So in 8th grade I had to do cyber school for a good half the year because I had missed a fuck ton of school. So while I'm just chilling and procrastinating, I get a call from a girl I didn't really know.



I pick up and it's a different girl I knew even less about. She asks if I know anyone who could love her. My response was immediately a ""look, you're asking the wrong guy. I haven't been to school in months.""



She sounds noticeably disappointed, so instead of awkward silence, I say ""alright, well I'm gonna get back to doing whatever it is I do on a daily basis."" To which she responds ""alright, you go back to masturbating.""



Like *fuck*, never have I heard someone so passive aggressive. I'm 100% sure I dodged a bullet because I found out from a mutual friend later on that she was toxic as hell. And I know she was planning on asking me out too because that same friend mentioned I was single and the girl immediately wanted my number.

34020,"Can't get out of financial debt. Thinking about suicide.Hello /r/SuicideWatch

I have been a lurker so far, but as of today, I would like to express my feelings...somewhere. Better here, than telling my family.

I'm 27 and from Germany. My depressions and other psychological issues (including being afraid of meeting people, low self-esteem etc) have been a culprit since 11 years now, I tried to commit suicide a couple times already. First time, when I was 17, last time when I was 19.

I have been in Therapy around 6 times by now (I can't really recall the correct number), switched between several anti-depressants and the Medical Officer I had an appointment with last year, diagnosed me as being ""Unable to work for an unknown time"" and signed the papers.

Since then, and this is really stupid, I compensated this with spending a good amount of money for Gifts for my Family. Ranging from Cigarettes, Sweets etc to PC Games, just to make them happy and kind of feel a bit better inside.

Anway,

This now led to the situation, that my Bank Account is overdrawn. I was able to do this, since I had a small job for a year, where I had an income of roughly 400€, the amount you are allowed to earn over here without having to pay taxes. It was a Home-Office Job. I had to get up at 8 in the morning and work for 4 hours a day. Not that much and I was able to pull it off.

The Bank then gave me a Credit limit of 1200€.

I lost the job after this one year, because the company had to ""restructure"". Meh, they nearly went bankrupt, that's why.

This is what really downed me (next to several other things, like being single and having a lot of old friends around me in a relationship, one of my brothers married).

I'm still living at home and have to deal with it, that my Mom has to take care of me, help me financially, but I just can't ask her for a full 1200€ paycheck to help me even out my bank account.

I just don't know anymore on how to cope with the depression, low self-esteem, the mistakes I made and that I actually kind of did everything to make me get into this situation.

I really wish, there would be a quick way to end it right now, without pain, since I don't want to feel pain anymore.

Is there such a way?",depression

Middle school dropped my self-esteem to the ground and now I can’t imagine anyone wanting to be with me. I’m struggling with my sexuality and my parents are homophobic so I can’t imagine coming out going well for me. I tried talking to my mom about how I was literally about to end everything and kill myself last semester but I just got yelled at and called ungrateful. She told me that people go through tougher shit than I have and that her and my dad are too busy to deal with my issues now. I’m always there for my friends when they’re down and I don’t talk to them about my issues because I don’t want to drag them down. I feel like I’m at a dead end right now and just want this semester to end already so that I can have at least some of this weight off of my shoulders. I tried therapy for about 2 years a while back and it was working but my parents made me feel shitty for going because each meeting with my therapist cost $60, so they took me out of it because it was expensive.

I do feel better now but I can feel myself sinking again. I just don’t know what to do right now and I’m lost. There might be grammar errors in this but I don’t care.

2.  I would miss out on good foods.  

3.  I would miss out on the first colonization of Mars and potentially Titan, Europa, and Callisto.

4.  I would miss out on the slim chance that some newly discover surgery could fix me.  

5.  I would have suffered for nearly 3 decades for nothing.

283693,"Despite my life being pretty awesome on the outside, I deeply deeply want to dieThis is my first throwaway. Thank you for listening and please understand that I lead kind of a queer life (you'll see).

I have been terribly depressed since around age 14 (age 20 now), along with some anxiety problems, including a phobia. Though I feel the depression acutely almost every day, I also understand that on the outside my life is awesome: I go to college, have my own place with some friends, am in a great and non-monogamous relationship with a really quality guy (he works with children), and I have a pretty good-paying job in my future field. I have only seriously contemplated suicide a couple of times, and I think the last time was in high school, though I don't remember why.

Two years or so ago, I came out to myself as transgender. Since then, I have been slowly socially transitioning, and the result has mostly been positive and has helped me feel more comfortable with myself. Most of my friends now accept me as a regular guy, including my boss and coworkers. However, the day-to-day grind of feeling deeply uncomfortable with my body really wears me down, and the few reactions of disgust or disapproval, depending on who they come from, can really really really hurt. Just had to deal with this today: a friend who I thought I could trust very politely told me that she is ""conservative about these sorts of things,"" pretty much meaning that she thinks transgender people are somehow ""wrong"" and I am actually devastated. Random strangers being dicks just make me feel disdain, but when friends do it I wonder what other thoughts about my gender people are hiding.

Around October of '12, I began to get sick of my depression. I was bored of letting it define me, disappointed that I often did not have the energy to do my schoolwork, and it hurt my boyfriend's feelings that I slept all the time instead of spending quality time with him. I went to go see a doctor, who prescribed me Zoloft, and I have been taking a relatively low dose since. It helps my anxiety a LOT, but it has barely touched my depression. Recently-ish I fucked up remembering to take it, but it was a catch 22 because my sex drive came back (and the lack thereof had been causing relationship stress). I am back on it again but I'm probably gonna need to go back to the doctor so she can help me experiment more to figure out what's right for me.

This weekend was really hard: my boyfriend was out of town, so on Friday I slept alone which was nice because I sleep like a starfish but also really lonely, and the next night my friend and sometimes lover A slept over, which was very enjoyable. That same night, though, I was forced to deal with my phobia in a big way, and so as not to look bad in front of my lady friend, I chose to try to swallow my multiple panic attacks for the most part. She left in the morning and later in the day Boyfriend came home from his trip, and we immediately got into a huge fight about irrelevant stuff. I guess when I say it like that it doesn't sound very stressful, but this is also on top of housemate drama, a complete lack of energy, new work responsibilities, etc.

For the first time in a very long time, I find myself thinking things like, ""Well, I don't have to do this homework because tomorrow I'll be dead"" or ""I wonder who they're gonna get to do this at work after I'm gone."" Sunday night I was very very serious about curling up in the snow and freezing to death (I live in the most Canadian part of America), but the weather was actually too warm.

To deal with these feelings, I like to get new piercings. I can feel pain in a way that is constructive (instead of just the usual self-harm), I make my body more like I want it to be, and I have something to keep track of and take care of as it heals. I got two new piercings Monday (numbers five and six) and it calmed me down for only like, five hours. So basically it didn't help like it has in the past.

I managed to type this out pretty calmly and everything, but I am so desperate here. I really don't want to hurt the people who love me, but I really really can't go on living. I have absolutely no energy, have been doing the bare minimum in classes (when I even go), and have really been straining my relationships with my constant bouncing between clingy neediness and outbursts. I sleep more than 12 hours on most days, but always feel too completely exhausted to function. After six years with maybe only 3 months total of ""remission,"" I feel completely hopeless about the possibility of ever feeling happy or even normal. Over the 7 years that I've been depressed, I learned some ways of dealing with it, but none of them are working. I'm just totally at a loss of what to do.",depression
19729,"I've Tied a Noose Up in my ClosetI just finished the noose in my closet. I have a tweet scheduled to be sent in 30 minutes, telling people where to locate my body and that my daughter is asleep in her room.

My daughter just woke up, her hugs are nice, it feels good to have someone completely love me unconditionally and honestly. I just don't know if it's enough - I don't want this life. This isn't how I  envisioned my life being.

I can't help but listen to [this song](http://listen.grooveshark.com/s/Where+d+You+Go+feat+Holly+Brook+And+Jonah+Matranga+/1NOMby) repeatedly - my wife cheated on me and ran off across country. I was raised in a normal, happily-married, family - my only goal in life was to have a family that I loved, that loved me and that I could care for. I have obviously failed in this endeavor and the pain in confronting this failure is too much to handle.

I think about it constantly - I'm a shell of a person, every day is the same shit over and over: wake up at 5, take my daughter to daycare, get off at 5, pick her up, cook dinner, put her to bed at 8, wallow in my own sorrow until midnight, repeat. Every goddamn day it's the same exact shit and I'm fucking tired of it. If I were dead, her mother would get $750k, she'd go stay with her - her problems would be fixed and I wouldn't feel this pain anymore.

My wife and I are trying to work through our issues but really, how much can you work through when your thousands of miles apart? What kind of relationship is that? When the trust has been broken, how do you rekindle it from thousands of miles apart? Do I even really want to rekindle that trust or am I just a complacent fucking tool, getting taken advantage of?

I need your help reddit - I honestly don't want to do this but I don't see a way out. I'm tired of being a single father, I'm tired of being cheated on. Every day is worse than the last, every day I go deeper and deeper into the darkness, I'd rather just get it done with while my daughter is still too young to understand,

I can't just take off to some sort of camp/medical group - who will take care of my daughter? Obviously not her mother. I'm paying for 2 households right now and my decision comes down to keep wallowing within this filth (to earn a paycheck) or relief (and let them live off the life insurance).


**Edit**: I called the 1-800 number FreeRadd posted, got in touch with a very nice person that just listened to me. I've taken down the noose, going to bed and my daughter and I are going to go out and have some fun this weekend (Chuck E. Cheese, I imagine, as horrible as that sounds to me - she fucking loves it).

For about 16 years I have been dealing with depression. And in that time, I have even succeeded to a point.... (I am still here)

But for the umpteenth time, I find myself sitting here alone for weeks wondering why I bother. Is a life spent alone worth living? Really. That's a legit question. 

I know some of you will read this and want to comment that you're here. But that's the thing... you aren't either. I have been living a life alone for so long that I don't believe that \*anyone\* is there to help. I have reached out. I have let my close ""fiends"" know that I am walking the line. They were kind enough to let me know that they were there to talk if I needed to (lol.)

They know me. I don't reach out for help... like ever. And the fact that I came to them looking for solace of some sort was a warning by it self. But then I also told them that I am ready to give up on life. The conversations naturally led that way because I am normally a happy-go-lucky kinda guy. I love to make people happy. But as of late, I can't even make myself smile unless I am thinking about ways to get out of life.

I am having a hard time finding a reason to continue beyond family and the (seemingly) persistent lie that things will get better. I have been trying/waiting for things to get better for the better part of a decade. And I just don't see a point in suffering anymore.

I don't know that I am presently suicidal. But I have had some actions and many, many thoughts that would leave a healthy person to believe otherwise.

Note: Needs more research for conclusive evidence

It’s been 5 hours Yes my findings weren’t false the specimen isn’t horny, although if I revealed the specimen the other insects would devour the subject within mere seconds.

I believe this is a mutated insect that suppresses how horny the average teenager is. I must gather more research. Although I have shared my opinion with my peers: they agree this is revolutionary. Certain individuals gain an almost cult like following, these ones tend to be slightly less or more horny. HOWEVER  this must be an insect that wishes to lay low and pick of people from the side lines truly fascinating.

Note: normally the horny beetle increases urges this one suppresses it but why?

I have delved into researching more mature specimens that have been infected with the mutated insect, it appears that the insect is cannibalistic in nature and one by one slowly abducts members of the subreddit under the guise of them ‘leaving’ or ‘taking a break’ very smart creature indeed.

323949,"Is there really a need to care much about politics when you’re not old enough to vote? So this question is more geared towards Americans due to the extreme polarization of the country right now. 

My parents seem to almost be offended that I didn’t really care when they told me who Biden chose as his VP. I said that I really don’t have much of a need to know the details right now, especially considering that I won’t even be able to vote by the time the election comes around. I get that it’s important, but especially right now when you literally cannot get away from politics no matter where you go, I’m really just not interested. While my parents and I both hope Biden wins, I don’t really know what they want me to do.

I am 26 years old this year. I manage my own business for about 6 years. Unfortunately things had to come to the end. There is no longer a purpose or motivation to drive me further.

My Father impersonated my identity to took out credit loans through the banks. He orchestrated everything from forged emails, phone calls and signatures. It took 1.5 years for me to found out once my Father could not keep it under wraps. 

I have attempted to sell my house and my car in hopes to reduce my debt burden and expenses. Banks wouldn’t care much about how the loans were signed. All at the expenses of my business liquidity. 

I had painstakingly left school to operate a shop front, worked everyday with little sleep, only to found out my Father had sold me to the banks to be a slave. The emotional blow was too hard for me. My family members could not support me due to the past experience with my Father and ended up finding fault in me. There is so much indignant in my situation.  The thought of no hope in climbing back up at all pains me too much. I regretted trusting my family members so much. I regret trying my attempt to be a entrepreneur. I should have known my place and be ordinary. I’m sorry to anyone whom I had unknowingly  offended. I’m sorry for being arrogant that one day I could use my abilities for charitable purposes. 

If anyone read this, I hope you could learn or take extra precautions to prevent these from happening.

The doc tomorrow is supposed to be ""better"" than the free one, and I really don't want to go all because I think I can get different meds on the next visit to the free one. But I don't want to wait that long. See? Roller coaster. 

And with the ""better"" doctor, at least for the time being, I'm just going to end up asking dad for more money to help out and pay for more visits and medicine, probably bloodwork at a busy medical facility, and I feel that if I just save the money in my account for something else \(I desperately need cigarettes\), then I'll be fine. It feels like such a tug of war. I may sound coherent, but I'm tired of sitting around doing nothing, life is not going anywhere. I've been out of medicine for a couple of weeks now after OD'ing on Zyprexa for a quick high.

People openly make fun of me and how long it's taking me to graduate. From my family to strangers. I hate myself already guys, I get it. I'm a piece of shit who sucks up money and never makes any progress. My family 100% told my extended family that I did a medical withdrawn from classes last semester. Nobody has mentioned it but everyone looks at me and doesn't know what to say. They don't joke around me like they used to. They just look at me like I'm a black sheep who's using my parents money and making excuses to not move on. I'm sorry. I really am.

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist today and I was honest with them about what was going on. My psychiatrist got mad at me. I know I fucked up again, I'm not proud of it. I explained how bad a situation I'm in and their solution was to talk to my professors. That's it. I need to beg my professors not to flunk me and to work with me to get passing grades this semester. If even one of them doesn'help me I flunk out of college and the last five years of my life verify I'm a complete waste of space.

I would rather kill myself. Literally I'm here contemplating who what stuff should go to. How to get carbon monoxide to build up around me or if drinking bleach would actually kill me. I have no friends to go to. It's mostly just nice items in a video game I want to go to someone who will appreciate them. How do I give them to someone without raising any flags or get them to accept them?

My psychiatrist said she wants to hear from me by Friday at a certain time to know I've talked to my professors. So I guess that's when I need to be dead by. I can't take it anymore. I can't stand fucking up. I know I need to face up and accept reality but I can't. I tried every day, for years, to get somewhere. I got so close. 138 credit hours. That's how far I came. I just want to drive somewhere secluded, walk into the woods and jam a knife into my neck.

I'm sorry everyone for wasting your time for so long. I tried. I really tried to fight for so long, but I think it's time for me to accept that I'm beyond help and that I need to be dead. I can't deal with whats around me anymore. It constantly feels like I'm going to throw up from being anxious around anyone and everyone. I'm nauseous because I know I need to do things and I just can't. I just feel more and more sick. More and more guilty. I have panic attacks while driving now. I'm sorry. I have nothing else left. I really wish you all more success in your fight than me, but I think this is probably going to be my last post. I just need to get this off my chest.

52636,"Not really sureI guess I'm having suicidal ideation. I'm just overwhelmed. A therapist has suggested anxiety medication. I'm not interested in relying on drugs. I understand that its replacing potential chemicals that are not being produced. I'm just not willing to try it. 

I have a pornography addiction that I've been attempting to get away from with little success. Even recognizing the adverse effects I continue to participate. This last relapse, I made the decision to get back into porn because I was feeling a certain way, anyway, probably vulnerable and I saw a woman figure in a effing video game that was desirable so i went home and it's been off to the races ever since. I've been on r/NoFap and I've felt grateful for the people I've spoke to from that sub. It feels like following that sub is a bit of a trigger and there a lot of ""motivational"" posts that just dont feel right to me. 

I truly believe I have let this addiction change who I am. Even my preferences have changed. I find trans women attractive now. I know that its widely accepted, but I feel there was a time when I knew i could turn away but it felt good in a fucked up sort of way, so I stayed. The pleasure is different than what I've ever recieved from cisgender girl porn. So this makes me feel perverted and maybe insane, knowing something doesnt align with my beliefs but participating anyway and more rapid than ever before. 

My dream has always been to marry a girl and have children. Maybe now it's a little less in that I just want to marry a girl. I feel like I've seen what love and marriage is but I've never experienced it, and I think I want to. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking that there are things I'm just not willing to give up, yet. One obviously being porn. I cant love a girl and look at porn especially trans porn and expect to have a good relationship or sex life. 

So the ideation comes in when I'm deep in addiction and not seeing a way out. When my therapist has encouraged, encouraged, encouraged me to reach out to other people in recovery(drugs/alcohol). I clam up and I'm not seeing a way out. I need a sponsor for drugs and alcohol but I've got what I feel like is a more serious addiction. I'm clean 3 months. I talked to a guy tonight and it was nice. I just dont see the hope I saw before. 

There was a girl that i shouldn't have talked to but i did and now I feel love for her. I cant talk to her now. Shes remaining faithful in her relationship. Which is good. I knew going into recovery from drugs and alcohol that I did it for me regardless of her coming along. Theres been gleams of hope here and there where I thought she may come back but there has also been times where I've really felt happy with me. It seems like a paradox I'm happy with me, I need no one. I hate me, I need someone. She cant fix my porn addiction or any addiction.

I think I know the answers:
Stop looking to the future.
What's right here and now.

What do I have control over? 

Nothing. I cant control that I love her. I'm trying to control the fact that I'm getting better for myself  and not her but shes still there. I still have hope for a future with her. A guy on here says,""you should stop."" No shit I should I just dont fucking know how. She may not even be that great anymore, or maybe she never was.  What I'm doing today, is praying for her (and his) happiness and success in their relationship. Trying to remove resentments I've made with her S/O. Loving them both. And the answer is letting them go. Moving on. Grieving, I guess. It's likely that our love is past due, and maybe, all it ever was was a dream. 

But I'm struggling to see there ever being another like her. Maybe trying to accept that being alone is what I need and not finding reasons to off myself because of those circumstances. But that dream I had as a boy sticks with me. Love",depression

233651,"It's late and I assume I may not get any, but I need help.For the past year and a half or so, I have been entirely overcome with guilt and shame. It was during this point in my life that I made a choice that is now my most burning regret and I feel as if I have nowhere to begin. Firstly, I am autistic. This has caused me to lead a very lonely life, even when at times I do not want to, however those times are rare. You could say that I am exponentially independent but everyone needs someone at times, I suppose. I am currently 19 years of age and come age 11 I began experimenting various methods of self harm ranging from scratching and burning to cutting. Counselors have often asked, how could you begin so young? I suppose these are all things I have learned from seeing my mother do them as a child. At age 13, I began to experiment with several drugs and in turn became dependent upon more than one. At 14 and since I have struggled with bulimia and binge eating disorder off and on. At 15, I was raped while I had been dating a boy. He was fairly popular, had a lot of friends and all of them told everyone that I was a whore and a slut, among various other things. I accept now that they did this because of some kind of issues within themselves, but the outcome of these actions were the years of bullying that followed. That can be hard to forgive, when you go to school and each time you turn your head someone is laughing at you or giving you dirty looks and saying horrible things to you and you don't even know their name. At a point in my life when I thought I could not feel more alone or disgusting or dirty, everyone around me made sure I felt much more than I already had. After I'd finally had enough, I left my high school at the end of my sophomore year to achieve my diploma from a charter school. I often look back on my life and I feel very ashamed. I think of the hurt I caused my parents, whom I love very much. I feel sorry for my best friend who has had to watch me struggle. I think of how a majority of people in my town have a very untrue predisposition about who I am, which I thought would have ended upon leaving my high school. It didn't. I wish I could have had a normal life and a normal childhood but all I see looking back in retrospect and even looking at myself now is me being plain fucking weird and out of place. I look back and wonder why I am 19 years old and I can't even feed myself like a normal person. I see myself feeling anxious and aimless when I sometimes can't even think of why. I want to excel, I have so many dreams for my future and I truly am such an ambitious person. I love animals and science is one of the only things I've ever truly excelled at. I would like to major in psychology and somehow land myself a job in a zoo. The dilemma is that I fear failure in that department. It is a gamble to want a job with animals. It is a gamble to want a job as a chef. It is a gamble to want to be a musician, own a bakery, or be a painter. All the things I can see myself loving are a gamble. My future is 50/50, any which way. I feel sad because I feel like my friends have it all figured out, their futures. A neurosurgeon, a nurse, an unbelievably promising musician. I feel a bit envious, but so proud of them at the same time. These feelings can conflict with each other. Growing up, my mom has had bipolar disorder, PTSD, addison's disease, panic/anxiety disorder, and as much as I love her it has been hard. It has been hard to be her only sense of purpose in life, and now in turn she is mine. I know that if I were to end it all, she would do the same and I could never leave my dad alone because he is my absolute best friend. I feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility to stay alive for the sake of my mother's happiness. This is and has been a gargantuan weight to carry. While we love each other enough to basically keep each other alive in a sense, as she has bipolar disorder I feel as if she has said some things and done some things that are hard to forgive. It is hard when one day you are someone's best friend, a great daughter, they are so proud of you and then the next day you are an idiot that they wish had never been born, that they want to run away to get away from you. I remember every single time she's wanted to run away and leave and just abandon me, and I am so thankful that she never has for long. I remember seeing the cuts on her arms and her in and out of psychiatric hospitals for numerous suicide attempts. I am endlessly thankful that she is still here, but because of her actions I feel invaluable and like I was never good enough for my mom, the one whose supposed to love me the most. It is kind of silly considering my previous contrasting statement of how I am her only sense of purpose. We have a complicated relationship. I remember every time anyone has said something hurtful to me on a personal level and it replays in my head. Any time I've felt violated, any time someone's called me stupid or anything else. Through all these lonely years, I've found only one person who has been a glimmering light at the end of this shitty fucking tunnel and I am about to lose them as a repercussion of a mistake I'd made and learned from. I feel like I hate myself and I feel angry at myself and undeserving and incapable to fulfill my basic human needs. I will barely sleep, or sleep for 15 hours. I have to drag myself to the shower, and force myself to eat. I feel defeated. I feel silly to complain about something going on inside of a romantic relationship on the internet but when you truly love someone and you have an unbelievably hefty conscious, it's nearly unbearable. This is the part of my life that is bothering me the absolute most right now. I feel like there is absolutely no where for me to turn or to begin. I feel completely and utterly lost like I never even thought I could. The only person I ever had to hold me when I felt even remotely close to this is the person I am losing and I feel like a completely despicable and worthless waste of space. I get it, you're not supposed to make someone your whole life. I'm not sure that's what I've done, but what I do know for sure is that I've never met anyone that I feel like could share my life for as long as maybe even forever. I feel like my future is in shambles, everything I'd hoped for. I really need someone to talk to, to whom I can actually elaborate about what is going on. I apologize if this appeared as rambling, it is only that these feelings are overwhelming and I feel as if I can't go on or that there is no point. ",depression

now 4 years later and i know it’s dramatic to say that he ruined my childhood and life but i feel like he really did well i guess i shouldn’t blame him it’s not his fault if anyone messed up it was definitely me for adding to his urges

First off, I will be using first names, as I intend to show this to a friend. Hopefully he can provide support. He's a good guy, and he's provided me with emotional support in the past.

Second, this will be a sort of rant about life, but it will also be me trying to get some help comprehending what's wrong with me. 



Alright, so here we go. Let's do this.

I would like to begin my wall of text with a pretentious, asshole-ish statement. I think I'm smarter and, by far, better spoken than any other person I know personally. I am aware of how much of a loser I sound for saying that, but I mean it, and not in a snobbish way. I genuinely feel as though I have a better understanding of people, emotion, and reality than any of my friends. What I feel to be my one unique quality has turned me into a horribly cynical, negative person. I have serious problems finding things funny anymore. I now default to looking at something and analyzing it, despite knowing that it's meant to be humorous.

I used to be extremely funny. It's the reason I have the 3 great friends that I do. But this year, my junior year of high school, my shit hit the fan. Life went reaaaally downhill for me. I recognize my decline, but I don't know how to stop it. I used to be a funny, outgoing kid, but not anymore. Instead, I'm this emotional wreck for reasons I have a hard time comprehending, let alone explaining. 

So I have three close friends: Gerry, Don, and Kanai'i. They're all funny, great people, and I used to be like that too. To quote Gerry, ""You used to be the funny one, but Kanai'i replaced you this year"". 

The three of us hang out on occasion, but more often than I not, I don't get invited. A normal weekend for us will consist of me waiting on them to text me back, only to see them on facebook, tagging each other and talking about how much fun they had. In fact, at lunch yesterday (the four of us share a booth), they went on about an awesome party that they openly admit declining to invite me to.

I feel as if I've now become the infamous third wheel (or rather fourth, in this situation, I suppose). My friends, namely Kanai'i and especially Gerry, tell me they care, and I believe them, but I don't think they understand. I tried telling Kanai'i how I feel these days, but he just told me I need to lose weight, which brings me to my next point.

I've never been a real attractive guy. In fact, I'm not a good looking guy, at all. I have a weight problem, and that only makes it worse. We're not talking morbid or Fat-Albert territory here, but noticeable enough that it makes me quite unattractive and socially awkward. I can hold an intelligent conversation with the best of them, but when it comes to someone of the opposite sex trying to make small talk, I just can't do it. I get so aware of my appearances that I end up unable to look them in the eye while conversing, and often sit in awkward positions that I've convinced myself help make me look thinner and direct attention away from my chronically shitty haircut.

I have a girlfriend, despite all my physical quirks. Or, sorta, at least. I'm not really sure what to call her anymore. It started off as my first relationship with a girl, and she was someone I'd had a strong crush on for nearly 2 years. So, when I finally got her to go out with me, I did what anyone would do: I got attached. And now, these last few months, I've really realized how little I mean to her compared to my feelings for her. Though it may not sound like much, that realization has really messed me up. I think she might be insane, but that's a whole 'nother story that I probably won't bother telling. We fuck like rabbits and it doesn't help me feel better. I just rue the day (May 19th, actually) when she graduates (she's a senior, I'm a year younger) and leaves me alone when she goes off to college. It's helped to steadily increase the progression of my declining sense of humor and fuck-giving. 

I feel so desensitized a lot of the time. Things just don't impact me in ways they used to, whether they be positive or negative. I don't have fun playing video games on my brand new gaming computer. I just can't find joy in them anymore. I am completely unable to motivate myself to do anything for school. I literally will just pass up the opportunity to do an easy assignment worth lots of points, simply because I don't want to do the work. I know how smart I am, and I know I could finish the work, but I just don't. I don't know why.

My friends know how I feel, sorta, and they know how broken I am thanks to this girl (not really her fault per se, but she plays a strong role in my depression), but I don't think they realize how serious it is. I think about suicide every day. Not so much how to carry it out, because I don't have a realistic means of ending it painlessly and quickly, but more how better it might be just to make it all go away. I don't think I would ever go through with it for my family's and Gerry's sake (I tell him everything, and I suspect it would hurt him if I killed myself) but I still wonder. 


My real reason for telling all this is because I just want someone to tell me how to make it better. I know that it isn't an easy thing to do, making someone feel good, but if someone could provide some insight as to how to fix my life, please do. 

There's much more, but I'm too tired to finish. I need sleep. If this has any views by tomorrow, I'll finish it after school. I also apologize for any trouble you may have trying to decipher my way of speaking. I tend to say/type things exactly the way I'm thinking them, and forget to format them so others can make sense of them. I don't see any red lines under my words, so my normal number of typos should be reduced. If not, I'll fix those tomorrow. 

TL;DR I'm probably being overly dramatic and my hormones are getting the best of me, but I feel hopelessly lost. I don't know what to do with my life. 

I probably won't hurt myself, but I figured that since I still think about it, r/SuicideWatch was a proper location for this.

125569,"My story.I just want to start this out by saying I'm not looking for help or anything. I just want to share my story with others who suffer as I did, and if it can help even one of you overcome what you are going through then I have done my job here. I am also using my actual account so if anyone ever needs to talk, I'm here for you.

 I was homeless due to a breakup with the man of my dreams, all of my family except my mother had disowned me for my announcement that I wasn't a christian as I had been pretending. At the time I had a job at a small coffee shop and was looking for an apartment. While staying at a friends for a night there was a party, I ended up being drugged and date raped by two supposed friends. Both of which were police officers sons. I woke up the next morning only having dream like memories of what had happened and bruises everywhere. I had the opening shift at 5am so i decided I would try to just be ok and make it through until my boss came in so i could go to the hospital. When my boss came in I sobbingly explained what happened and informed her I needed to go to the er right away, she told me no, I had to finish my shift. So I walked out, leaving me jobless. 

So no family, no money, no house, no job, and losing the love of my life, I was at rock bottom. No amount of alcohol or weed could make me forget my pain for even a moment. A friend took pity and allowed me to stay with him. He was a junkie and one day I told him I was considering killing myself because I just couldn't cope anymore. He offered to let me try some morphine and I accepted, hoping it could dull my pain. So in a bathroom, sitting on a toilet seat, he helped me shoot up for the first time. Everything went away, I felt happy for the first time in so long, I was instantly addicted. I shot up every day for about 2years. 

One day I got back into contact with the man I had mentioned (we will call him K) Well K had seen what happened to me and wanted to try to help me. He took me in and gave me the support I needed and I was clean for about another year. We ended up losing our apartment because we both lost our jobs. He moved back with his parents and I moved in with a friend. For some reason after that we just couldn't make things work after that and our relationship ended. 

My entire reason for being clean and the one stable thing I had in my life was gone in a moment. At this point I had a bad reputation around town and couldn't get a job, so I began selling weed for a friend of mine to cover my part of the bills. I began slowly using again, behind my friends back because I didn't want to be kicked out. My depression was creeping up on me again and I began to feel helpless. After a few months K and I once again started talking. We decided to start hanging out again and I stopped using. I was seeing another guy casually at the time (we will call him D). After a couple months of hanging out with K and I broke things off with D. 

One day I received a phone call from D that was him freaking out and blaming me for all of his problems and telling me I would never be anything but a useless junkie. He was so vicious that in my fragile, still depressed state I lost it and attempted suicide. 

K had been texting with me and knew I sounded depressed. After not hearing back from me he showed up at my house and called an ambulance. The paramedics told me if he had shown up 20 minutes later I would be dead. K rode with me in the ambulance and cried the entire time promising he wouldn't let anything happen to me.

At the hospital, once I was fully alert the doctors asked K to leave the room. They then informed me that I was pregnant, about 2 weeks along. In that instant, everything changed. I knew that though I am not perfect, I would give anything to raise a healthy, happy child. K came back in the room and I informed him. I told him right then and there that he could either stick with me or not, but I was keeping the baby. K looked right in my eyes, kissed me, and told me he wasn't going anywhere. 

Things were rough for a while and we have had some bad times. But I now have a beautiful 2 year old little girl who is the light of my life, and K is still right by my side. I am currently in training for the job of my dreams at a tattoo shop, we own our own house complete with a nice yard and  a little garden.  I love my life and every day and I cant believe the transformation from my old self. I have never once touched a drug since either. 

Sorry for such a long story but I felt I needed to share with the people who need it most. Please believe me that things can get better. It takes hard work and it wont be easy. But you CAN turn things around like I did. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

31795,"Thrown-ness is MeI used to see so much merit in the idea of triumph. Striving against all the struggles of life and finding the strength to keep going and better myself.  Now all of that just seems to me like an idea implanted in me by the existence i found myself in in order for me to stick around longer and be tortured slowly.

     Ever since i was about 14 or so Ive had this kind of dissociative disorder i guess you could call it.  Its hard to put into words but its just a feeling of incredible malevolence directed towards me by a world that isnt actually real.  Not real in the way Im led to believe that it is anyway.  Its as if everyone is in on this sick cosmic joke except for me and the whole goal is to make me suffer, but always with the right amount of hope and happiness thrown in so i dont catch on and so that it hurts all the worse when its taken away.  Just like Sisyphus, so who knows, maybe its my punishment and I deserve it.

    I am aware of how insane this is and I always strive to live my life under the assumption that none of that is true.  Because I need it not to be.  The trouble is that its more of a feeling than any kind of thought process I can control.  Full on existential dread.

       About 2 and a half years ago I was able to fight my way out of that hell and for the first time in years I was able to just live and not be constantly dogged by that feeling of helplessness, though it was always there in the back of my mind.  It was right after this that I was lucky enough to meet the most beautiful amazing person I have ever encountered in my life.  She just made everything real again and I was not only free of that awful head space but I was actually feeling intense joy and happiness and I felt like my life actually had meaning beyond the pointless suffering I had always thought it was intended for.

        And what did I do?  I destroyed it all of course.  I took the most incredibly beautiful thing I have ever found and crushed it.  All the evil dissociative feelings started to creep back in under the radar and without knowing why, I began to feel this intense dread and helplessness that was always there I guess.  Just waiting to test me.  Giving me enough space and confidence to obtain something I love and care for all for the sole purpose of having it die by my own hands and watching me suffer all the more.

        I ended up walking away because I couldnt bare the idea of subjecting her to a life with me.  I just have an overwhelming feeling that death is the only way out.  Any kind of fight I put up is just playing into the sick game and delaying the inevitable.  The thing that kills me is I just wanted her to have a happy life but now Im realizing all I did was cause her pain and sadness.  Moreover, what if she never ends up finding someone and ends up alone like me, or even worse, ends up with someone who treats her like shit?  This line of thinking flies directly in the face of my delusions, but thats just it, when it comes to her I genuinely feel like its all real and she actually cares about me.  Its something I havnt felt since I was a child, before the whole illusion came crashing down.

       Either way its all gone now and cannot be recovered.  Ive planned in a fail safe for myself anyway.  I have to stick around long enough for her to move on and be ok and forget about me and the pain I caused her.  That way, if I do this, she wont have to know or hear about it.  Above anything I just want her to be happy.  Hopefully in that time I will find some peace or another way out.  I guess the whole point of me writing this out is that Im hoping someone will be able to relate or help me in some way.  I want to be better and im trying, but this time around, knowing what I had and could have had and losing that forever, by my own hands none the less, is just making it seem futile.",depression

3750,"I'm just so tired of it allI have been struggling with chronic pain for 25 years since I was 14. I worked so hard at everything then and had a lot of good teachers and coaches that helped me to be excel. I lived in a small town and was from a small town where everybody knew me and my family and I always had a lot of pressure to be great at whatever I did and my best was never good enough. If I got a single B on my report card my parents would focus and that and why it wasn't perfect while other siblings that never even tried got rewarded if they didn't fail any classes. I was always doing more than my peers because I wanted to live up to the expectations others had for me. My 8th grade year I went undefeated in wrestling because I had a great coach who was happy with however I did. He was just as happy for everyone on the team when they gave their best no matter if they only won a single match all year and I thought that was great. He was the best and came from a foster home and just wanted to help kids have fun and treated everyone like they mattered and that's why I was so successful under him. The summer after that season my dad signed me up for several wrestling camps and after I asked him not to. I was a perfectionist and had been to several of these camps before and they push children to their breaking point and my parents could never understand that. So I went and did 3 wrestling camps that summer as I recall that were ran by middle aged guys that had gone to the Olympics and they were brutal and I would work out contantly  even when not in the camps because that is the kind of person I was. During camp I injured my neck and shoulder severely and laid on the mat thinking I was paralyzed from it and it took a lot of effort to even wiggle my fingers. Nobody even came over to check on me and eventually I stood up but my head just wobbled around like an infant learning to use its muscles. I managed to work up the strength to get through the camp and not miss any of it by just flexing every muscle I could to support my neck. When I went home and told my parents instead of taking me to the hospital they just had an argument about it. I had disclocated some ribs too and could see them protruding from my sternum. I continued wrestling while in school but was never the same after that. I took one year off after my sister died in a traffic accident because I didn't care anymore. The high school coach pulled me out of spanish class when I didn't show up for the first practice lecture me on how I was being a quitter and I would regret it. I just ignored him and went home and cried as I did often. That year off my dad finally took me to the family doc who just said it was a pulled muscle and to get physical therapy. I did everything that was asked of me and more and it didn't help. Then came chiropratic care which thankfully enabled me to turn my head again but the burning stabbing pain and the headaches from it were still constant. I just told myself that once I graduate from college and got out of this small town I'd find a doc with a brain that could help. I'd never had an MRI or even an x-ray and it was frustrating. Eventually I graduated and got a job and got married to a very kind person who was determined to help me. I've been to so many family docs, massage therapists accupuncture, surgeons, pain management docs and I can't even remember what else. After my first surgery a decade ago I had to quit my job because I couldn't even raise my dominant arm. When I was working before the surgery I would have to lay on the floor of my office for a couple hours a day to try to relieve the pain. I eventually was diagnosed with a severe labral tear, herniated discs throughout my entire cervical spine, arthritis in my neck, and radiculopathy that causes numbness in my arm. I have been living a spoonie life for a long time. If I don't do much during the day I can keep my pain at manageable levels but if I do anything that involves turning my head or using my dominant shoulder the pain quickly becomes unmanageable. When the pain is at a 9 or 10 I become suicidal and just want it to stop and to avoid the feelings I avoid doing much of anything to keep my pain down. Just carrying in groceries or doing computer work (my previous occupation) for an hour gets my pain out of whack.  I applied for disability insurance a few months ago and was denied. The independent company that made the determination sent me a letter saying to call if I had any questions or other info to supply and I called two or three times on different days and they wouldn't even answer the phone or return my call. They then proceeded to deny my application saying I wasn't disabled 5 years ago when I have been dealing with this for 25 years and had over a 100 pages of doctor notes covering the last 10 years of my medical history. I am so depressed right now as a result and am just tired of fighting this and don't see the point of living. I always wanted children but didn't have any because I didn't feel I could adequately take care of them since I can barely take care of myself. My wife wants me to get a lawyer and fight it but I am just so tired. I contacted one last night via chat then called them today and they didn't answer. I have called the suicide hotline a few time previously and am discouraged my the automated system that answers and hang up after waiting a couple minutes. Nobody seems to understand what I deal with on a daily basis except my wife who has watched me struggle with it every damn day, waking several times a night from severe pain over the past 15 years. I am lucky to have a loving wife that works hard to support us but I feel so guilty and useless and my pain wears on her too and isn't fair to her. She shouldn't have to put up with somebody like me. I love her so much but sometimes she gets overwhelmed and wants to leave for good and I understand. I am so depressed and have cut myself with razors just to see what it feels like. The pain from cutting is like nothing compared to the pain I feel constantly and is actually a nice distraction from my usual pain. I have considered swallowing all of my prescription meds but don't want to hurt the docs that prescribed them to me by doing that and don't want to hurt other patients who depend on these meds wither. I have also choked myself with my belt a few times and have been so close to killing myself over the years but don't want to cause my wife any more pain than I already have, she doesn't deserve that. If it wasn't for her I would probably be dead by now but that is an awful lot of pressure to put on her. I don't think I am going to kill myself now but am just having another hard time with a lot of suicidal thoughts and don't feel like I can take much more of this at the moment. We recently had to move across the country to a suburb of a major city and I hate it. It is so noisy all the time and I can't get any peace and quiet anywhere. I used to be able to drive a couple minutes to the river where I would just sit and meditate for hours multiple times a week but now I don't feel like I have any way to decompress. I have a service dog I trained myself that is with me all the time and that helps but she isn't happy in the city either. I hope we can move again soon but that upsets my wife. She likes her new job and took it despite my objections. I am trying so hard to get by and support her in her new job but I don't see her much anymore since she works 11 hours a day 5 days a week now on many weeks meaning I only see her around 2 hours a day when she gets home. We have planned vacations but they have been cut short due to her work projects and I fear that other scheduled vacations will face the same. Sorry to complain so much. I should be more grateful for what I have and know a lot of people have it worse off but it is hard sometimes. I am just so tired of living with sever pain 24 hours a day and feel like society doesn't want me in it. The gov is always trying to take away my medicine and I am always being judged by people for not working and being told by social security now that I am not disabled even after all the documentation I have makes me feel like nobody will ever understand what I go through. I don't need any responses, just wanted to type this all out and vent for a minute. If you have to choose between responding to me or someone else who has posted here please choose them over me and I'll understand. For others who are struggling with suicidal thoughts I am truly sorry and know there are no easy answers.",depression

I've been hospitalized twice. I'm covered in scars. I'm fucking sick and nobody will help me. 

My only release is 3 hours a day on the weekend when I get to train wrestling in a frigid room. I have four weeks left of that training and then work is going to steal all my free time and the wrestling shows will be gone. 

It was the only thing that gave me life again. I traveled from Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick helping at shows for free and fucking loved every moment.

Now I work this nightmare bullshit job as a pissant rent a cop over 2 hours away from my home by bus and soon that job will take my training from me. 

Next week I have to work 3 to 11 over 2 hours away by bus. Buses shutdown at midnight. 

So I'm going to get trapped on the other side of town.

I started this line of work at 19 and worked for one company for six years. I was hardworking and diligent and made minimum wage the whole time. No raises. No praise. Nothing.

Then I witnessed someone shove a knife through their face and burned out. Shared a news story about then company and got blacklisted. Company claimed we were family. 

Their Corporate funded EAP therapist said in response to the death I witness that nicotine is bad for me and I should stop smoking as that is raising my stress levels. Thanks boomer.

And if I have these disorders I would rather be dead.

A year ago I had a home and was in college despite not having any full time work. My ex threw me on the street for not wanting to have children. I burned throughly savings on hotels and planes, flew to Newfoundland and spent a couple months there. 

but my aunt sent me home for being shitty at lawn maintenance.  (Old style newfie. ""I dont believe in this depression nonsense"")

I came home to my moms until her landlord got nosey and made me paranoid. Threatened to evict my grandmother and mother unless she stopped allowing the homeless squatter on property. 

Came to the city and tried to get a job anywhere 

Mcdonalds, Call centers, insurance sales, grocery store anything to get away from this business and nobody will interview me let alone hire me Except to be a pissant rent a cop again.

This isnt a profession it's a goddamn joke. 

I'm a goddamn joke who is amounting to nothing. I'm broke all my money goes to rent. I'm eating once a day. My gym clothes are ruined so I might not even make training this weekend

I'm fucking 30 and have done nothing in life but fail. And all anyone does is remind me.

I cant sleep. I cant breathe. And now as I look at the time I have 3 hours until I have to go to unpaid training for a job I've done my entire adult life and DO NOT WANT ANYMORE. None of this is worth anything anymore.

208734,"I could easily beat a goose in a fight Ok, so recently I saw the vine with the girl saying, “Look at all those chickens!” That led me to some videos of people encountering geese and running away when the demonstrated aggression. Some of the scared people were kids, which I get, but an adult!! Running away from a goose. 

I’m not the most physically strong or trained in any martial art, but I could easily beat the shit out of a goose if it came at me. It has nothing to attack me with, besides a bite with its bill, and they don’t even have sharp teeth that could puncture my skin. Geese aren’t that smart either, often times they just rush their target head on, without considering their inferior fighting capabilities. Most humans have long enough arms to reach out and stop a goose before they even get into biting range. Geese also have a major disadvantage because of their long necks, which are easy to grab with your hands. The final nail in the coffin in my opinion is that many of the geese I saw didn’t even use their greatest advantage over us, flight. 

TLDR: Geese are dumb, and I could probably beat one in a one v one fight so you could too. Have no fear of these silly waterfowl, for you are the superior predator.",non-depression

I have found severely less motivation to do things, I have been so mad I am slamming all my doors. I have no other way of relieving this anger I have built inside me. I lived in the same neighbourhood since over 12 years ago and going for ""walks"" just dont suffice.

I am a 20M business owner and I am now suffering from depression. I simply cannot afford to move out of my house as I have so many things to pay off. I dont really have debt just yet however I am at the brink of breaking even especially with the corona virus. I want to move out so badly. I want to move out yesterday. I just cant fucking afford it because every dollar is so important right now.

I am miserable. I do not get along with my family. My mom kicked my dad out of the country who left before I was in highschool. I never thought of killing myself but every once in a while the thought now pops up in my head. My family is BLAMING me for their PTSD which I apparently caused from slamming the doors. I never raged at them or yelled at them. Yet they want to enforce on me that their problems are so much more important and valid and my fault. Fucking unbelievable. 

I don't really have many friends who I can go ""crash"" at. Right now I just want to permanently leave the house for good but I don't have the financial capability for me to do so. Plus everything in my business is based at my home address. I want to address this problem with them but they are so fucking inconsiderate I cant even bring myself to do it, I know I will just end up yelling or something and things will get out control. My mother has always been so fucking toxic and same with my dad which is why they broke up. Everything has to always be about her, how hard shes working, and how much she's suffering. I never signed up for this. My brother is a bystander but he has been doing absolutely NOTHING with his life (2 years older) so as the youngest sibling I feel like the ""man of the house"" and have to do everything. He has been indirectly messing with my mental health and stress levels by playing music at the worst times, staying up all night chatting with his gamer friends, etc . I dont want to say anything to him because he just got laid off from his job during quarantine. I am the room right beside him so he can hear everything I do and vise versa. I dont have any fucking privacy. I already have noise cancellation earbuds and a white noise machine and it doesn't cancel out everything.

I am going insane. I have always been trying to better myself everyday with my business and skills but it looks like I am lacking in real life. My family doesnt care about me as much as a family should. I am getting dangerously more tired of living life every day and I have nobody I can talk to out of this. I cant even find a space to call a hotline because my brother can fucking hear everything I say in my room. I need to move out but I cannot. I don't know what to do and I hate it.

178555,"Broken heart.I don’t know where to start... I’ve been in a relationship with a girl for almost 3 years with plans to be married (we were engaged). I’ve always loved her more than myself and always tried my best to be the best I could for her. She’s so gorgeous and perfect in my eyes and yet, since the beginning she was always clawing away at me. I’ve always been super popular and I put away everything, even my opportunity for the naval academy to be with her because I was scared to lose her. However, the red flags were massive and she could never communicate due to childhood trauma. My emotions were always ignored and I never got reassurance. Every time I would ask for sex (that makes me feel terrible... consent is important yeah, but I was so deprived of affection I had to ASK), she would go “mmm, I dunno.” And leave it at that. I’ve been constantly dealing with ignored emotions, and recently instead of working on things like we promised, she’s been at some other guys house without checking her phone. I moved back into my mothers and I’ve been so fucking sad. I have been dealing with PTSD (from being raped as a child), BPD, major depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I don’t understand how she could tell me she loved me and let me sit here at night drowning in my feelings... my god I just want to overdose, or crash my car, or stab myself. I recently started cutting and I’m destroying myself. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I’m constantly being left alone. I felt like the world was trying to leave me hints that she’ll come back and things will get better, but she won’t even answer my phone calls.... do I have no worth???? I’ve always been told that I’m amazing and smart and attractive, but the woman I LOVE, abuses me mentally. It’s so hard to have to deal with alone and I just want to end it. So. Badly. I have no one.. I just want someone, to hold me, and give me warmth, love and lust... but even now I can’t fathom it. I’m cold, and wet, and I’m ready to end my life. I’m sorry mom. I’m sorry I only made it to 20 and fucked up everything... I’m sorry mom that I’m leaving you with my debt from the hospital for trying to kill myself. No one deserves to feel like this.

83334,"The Desert (A Poem)This is my first time writing anything like this so I do apologize if its bad

The 6' by 6' room  
My prison of emotions  
Entering the room  
My emotions loomed...  
Emptiness...  
Desperate...  
Hopelessness...  
My mind once a forest  
Slowly turned to a desert  
Trees to dunes  
lush bushes to dry cacti  
Happiness and Sadness  
so different yet merged as one  
The once plentiful trees of joy  
now turned to dunes of despair

The bottle of tequila in one corner  
The small stick of death in another  
They were my only escape  
Helped my mind hallucinate  
It created an oasis in that desert  
An oasis of hopefulness  
All superficial  
An imitation of what others felt  
Ultimately my organs whipped with the belt  
I didn't care  
Hoping the substances would work  
Desiring they would slowly kill me

As my loved ones slept in peace  
I got drunk and high waiting for release  
Walking the tightrope  
Looking death right in the eyes  
""STOP!""  
""END THE PAIN!!""  
I pleaded  
To change the wasteland  
To nothing  
Asking him for a bullet to the brain  
or a bloody knife to end the pain...

This was my first time writing something like this but if you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts writing is a great and healthy release mechanism.

this decision was made 3 months ago to the date. on September 3rd. 
i was in an incredible amount of pain &amp; needed a plan. 

i decided that I’d find time to go to the beach. then return to my mother’s home where I’d do it. 

there was pain. at that time. 
over time the pain changed into vague apathy &amp; a general dissociation from this existence. 

early September was also the time i went into a deep isolation. stopped talking to everyone. in an attempt to protect myself. 

i don’t really have anything to say.
if i cared more, i would articulate all the ways i felt aggrieved. &amp; maybe demand some kind of ramifications but. that doesn’t matter. 
i’m not looking for sympathy. no one owes me anything. 

i think that i want to communicate that there isn’t going to be a “better” me. there’s some hopes that maybe if i go to therapy. something. 

sometime in September i wrote, ‘something inside me has died’

there’s nothing i am willing to work towards/to fix.

240985,"I need to be relieved.Sorry, this is awfully long. Im very appreciative of anyone who gives me the time this evening or whenever you stumble across this... 

I am the string that holds the chaos of 5 lives together.

The good things: 

I am a mother of three beautiful children. One is my own, two are my step children. 

I am the wife of a seemingly dedicated and devoted husband. 

I own a successful business and help provide a living wage for a staff of 15 and their families. 

I am privileged to have what most say is one of the most rewarding jobs out there (I coach/mentor extremely talented and intelligent kiddos... though that has been put on hold for the most part lately.) 

The bad things:

I am overweight. I’m pretty sure I’d be considered obese at this point. When I was 24 I was beautiful though I didn’t think it then, 5’0 - 116-126 pounds of pure female athlete. Now I’m 34 and 190 pounds. 

I have nagging injuries/old surgeries that are failing and causing me daily severe pain (ranging from 7-10/10 on most days.) I understand my weight is contributing to this. 

I know that I am suffering from long term effects of a series of concussions, the last of which put me in the hospital for a week. 

I have a food/overeating/binging  addiction that I cannot shake. 

I have an autoimmune disorder that causes severe completely debilitating itchiness. Same autoimmune disorder causes my joints to swell (adds to the pain) and I have had a rash on my leg/foot for nearly 10 years that has yet to be successfully treated. 

All of those things combined:

I feel angry all the time. I feel sick/under the weather all the time. I’m in physical pain ALL. THE. TIME. I hold it in. I hold my head down. I deal the best I can. But I know others are starting to see me fail. There are days I cannot walk and my husband has to help me. There are days I have to crawl out of my bed to get to the rest room because it hurts to walk. There are days I’m so itchy I can’t sleep. And there are days when I do manage  to sleep my dreams are filled with anxiety and this terrible dread.  Then there are some days that I’m 100% fine and I feel like people discredit the other things I’m experiencing. 

My step son (13) recently began to live with my husband and I full time. (His mother “couldn’t handle him anymore.”) He’s a great kid but needs a ton of guidance. I’m doing my best to get him in track in school (he was failing), set his head straight help him succeed as he has ambitious goals. He’s a great kid, but I find myself angry and frustrated at the situation... not him. The situation. He calls me mom now. Not my name. The weight of that is sometimes too much to bear... I’m afraid I’m going to screw him up more... 

Meanwhile, my own daughter is acting out. She’s spoiled rotten, selfish, ungrateful, entitled and just plain mean sometimes. She’s 10, emotional, and I’m sure the changes with our living arrangements are hard for her. But I’m just so utterly disappointed in her recently. I’m trying to be patient, but also committed to discipline I that I’m careful not to reward behavior that falls into the above categories. She told me tonight that she hates me and that I don’t love her. I know she doesn’t mean it... but it hurt. I feel like I already failed her. 

My husband... Maybe I shouldn’t have settled for my husband. He is a great husband now... but he wasn’t always a great or faithful partner before we got married. I thought I worked through the insecurities of his infidelity and lying phase (and I truly believe he has changed, and when we married I fully weighed what he did and thought I had reconciled it 100%) but I find myself resentful now, but not at him... 

I’m resentful now that I’ve lost my beauty and charm and wit and energy. Given how much I’ve let myself go, at this point I wish he would cheat again or find a girlfriend.  I’ve actually told him this... this made him understandably very upset. But he’s now always telling me I’m beautiful and he loves me no matter what, “you’re not fat”, more lies but different but still— i hate him for it. Why the hell is he still with me? I wish he’d leave me. Funny after all that turmoil early in our relationship— all that heartache and pain—- and I’m ready to let it go. 

Then there’s my mother. She has serious mental problems (ptsd and depression stemming from trauma caused by rape/incest) on top of physical disabilities in her old age. She still lives independently but relies on me more and more financially and emotionally (and not in a healthy way.) she lives with a roommate (an older veteran) who has taken advantage of her and enables/exasperates her mental issues. She recently granted me power of attorney to start putting her affairs in order and managing her finances but this hasn’t been easy. 

Side note: I was on meds as a teen— I don’t like them. I was put unnecessarily through the juvenile system and in and out of psych wards as a “troubled teen” (and somehow straight a student?!?!?) so I don’t care for “therapy” as it just really messed with my head. I was told I’d never be a functioning adult with meds... well I made it to Age 34... maybe they were right :/ 

I have of course tried exercising, changing my diet (nearly impossible as my husband caters to my cravings, and doesn’t support my efforts to be disciplined in that area), CBD oil for pain.... and of course every OTC and prescribed med under the sun for my physical and mental symptoms.... 

The diet change has the most drastic effect But the chaos of managing these kids and our finances and my mom and my business.... if I get off track I relapse worse than before and my husband enables the bad habits (he’s naturally thin- can eat whatever he wants.) I get it though- not his job to fix me. 

I feel like I’m stuck. Imprisoned in my marriage, my role as mother/step mother (I know that’s awful), my role as caretaker of my mom, my mind, and my body. I am desperate for an out. Any out. 

What scares me right now is not that I’m going to find a way to commit suicide tonight. And likely not tomorrow— but rather that I feel it coming. I feel me losing myself more and more every day. I feel me losing my will to continue on. It’s slowly chipping away at my sanity and I’m just left here exposed and raw and a bit numb. I am scared that when the right circumstances and the opportunity to rid myself of myself presents itself, I’ll suddenly find my motivation and follow through. 

Anyway, Thanks for reading. 

Goodnight, everyone.

Growing up, my family always struggled financially. I always told myself that I would one day make enough money to make her life easier for whatever remaining years she has. Then, once she was comfortable and eventually passed away (she has always had awful health problems), I could finally let go. I've had this thought since I was probably around 10 years old. I'm 24 now. It always gave me a feeling of comfort - another ""once /this/ happens, it will be okay"". 
I always feel like I'm just going through the motions, like a zombie. The silly thing is, I have excelled through school, I've had great loves (while they lasted), and I'm considered rather attractive and talented. I have a lot going for me now, after digging myself out of the hole I was born into. But I'm SO TIRED. It's harder and harder for me to get out of bed. All I want to do is sleep, and when I'm awake, I have no motivation for life. I feel so pathetic after working so, so hard in life and yet I still feel empty.
I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I'm not really looking for a solution or sympathy. I just need to vent, I guess.
I'm sick of working so hard with nothing to show for it - on the inside. On the outside, I'm doing great. On the inside, I feel dead.

199771,"Either this is the trough, or this one is gonna be bad...I've done this before, from both sides now. Temporary problem, permanent solution, etc. That shit loses its profoundness the hundredth time or so.

I'm 23, male, ex-Army Ranger, married, divorced, alone, possibly an alcoholic. Diagnosed with depression, PTSD, and moderate social anxiety. Not on meds, haven't seen my therapist for a couple weeks. Live with roommates but don't want to bother them again, it's not their job to take care of me.

I can usually beat these things with a funny movie, a walk through the park, and some food and sleep. I've eaten well, I can't watch film, I've hiked up Mt. Charleston and now I'm just lying in bed wondering if this is what I've got to look forward to: fifty, maybe sixty years of wanting to drink to wash away the pain? There's not even something concrete there to hurt me, it's just hard to wake up and live.

I got smashed drunk a couple nights ago. Started out okay, but quickly ended up crying, mostly naked outside my roommate's door begging for help. She sat up with me while I puked and cried. My other roommate, her husband, woke up to the noise I was making, and told me we needed to talk the next morning and I've been avoiding him since. I don't want to ""talk"". He's just going to lecture me, tell me to grow up, and I either have to nod, pretend to listen, or get into an argument with him about the line between concerned friend, and berating father. He deserves an apology, but God if I can't take another sermon on how I just have to make good decisions.

I started drinking that night because I'd just been on a date with a girl I'm falling way too hard for. She's smarter than me, which is fantastic. She's beautiful. She likes me. I got us concert tickets, we had dinner, and then I asked her if she wanted a drink at the concert, ordered and found out I had never bought beverages at a concert before. Like I'd budgeted terribly and had no money left. The drinks are poured, she's standing right there waiting and I just sort of look at her and mumble, ""Do you mind buying yours? I'm all out of money now.""

It had been a fine date, we'd had lots of fun; I'd been awkward and goofy, but she just smiled and teased me about it. It was okay. But standing there, realizing I'd just solidly buggered up a simple scenario, I kinda wondered, ""Is this a model for your future? Do you just keep rolling along, relying on the grace and patience of other people until you screw up big enough that people can't forgive you anymore?""

So she handles it with poise (I'm telling you, she's way cool) and we finish off the night. I drop her off and go home, pop open a beer to relax, because I'm still stressed about the date, etc. And one turns into two, and then it's on to whiskey, because if beer is good, then liquor is better. And then I'm sick and sad, and I'm in a dark place, hating myself and begging for help. And they give it to me. Because they're good people. And the ungrateful ass that I am, I don't want to listen to them tell me what they think I should do. I know I should stop drinking. I've done that. I know it's unacceptable to wake them up in the middle of the night, and I'm sorry. I'm already ashamed of myself, why do I have to let them kick me some more?

But what kind of coward can't own his mistakes? What right do I have to complain? Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

So now I'm here looking at all my accumulated crap. And it's not that impressive really. I'm still wearing clothes I owned in high school, a couple additions, but mostly the same shit. I've got a bookcase of fiction that's dragged me away from the real world and all my problems here. But I can't even escape into stories, because the love interest shows up in the first act and I want to burn the damn book, smash the TV screen, yell, scream and generally vent at the world, because in reality the love interest isn't a real thing. The story goes on a long time after, and the passion wanes, and they split, and new love interests show up, but now there's baggage and bullshit. And who wants to be with the poor bastard writing his sad pathetic problems to Reddit anyway?

And is that what life is? Five more decades of telling myself it'll get better if I can just get a better job, or if I see Europe by foot, or whatever arbitrary hurdle comes next? Promising myself that the next achievement will make everything worth it? It never has been. And I don't believe it ever will be. Just another ending and another hurdle in the distance. Fuck it. I'm out. You all go on building your great society, or tearing it down, or whatever makes you tick. I'm done.",depression

Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who sees it logically. If life has dealt me a bum hand and I’m having a shitty time, who does it benefit for me to plough through it for another 70 years? Certainly not me. Why should I go through all that hassle just to finally fall down, exhausted and a shell of my former self? So people can turn up to some shit party a half century from now and say, ‘oh that guy lived a long old life full of misery, he sure made the right call by not cashing in his chips as a young man!’ I think emptying my account, spending it all on a huge bender and capping it off with suicide sounds like a brilliant way to go, much better than waiting for some agonising disease to fuck me up when I’m old and alone. 

The objection I always see is, ‘what about your loved ones?’ Well... what about them? Either they will die first, or I will. Delaying it by a few years for the sake of it seems pretty pointless to me. I’m not wallowing in some Shakespearean tragedy over the prospect of death; it happens to everyone on Earth. It’s natural. I have no fear of what is ultimately the final act of departure. Always leave them wanting more, as they say.

It was Christmas, I think I was 9?, our family is quite poor + dysfunctional but my mother and her boyfriend would always get us (my siblings and I) a Christmas bear with the year written on the foot. Even at that young age I knew that we couldn’t afford much and I just couldn’t understand why we kept getting these bears when I would rather something more “practical” (clothes, shoes etc). 



I made the mistake of asking what the deal was with the yearly bear thing and I was mocked harshly for it. The following year while everyone else got a normal Christmas bear with the year and their name written on the feet, what I received would be referred to as a “suicide bear”. My parents played an elaborate “prank”, I was woken up to a small bang/popping sound. They set my bear up to look like it shot itself with a toy gun, complete with a suicide note, stuffing falling out of a hole in its face. 



This happened every year, each new year brought a new suicide scenario and suicide note. And as the only gay child in a homophobic family, these suicide bears came off less like pranks and more like suggestions. 



Today I struggle with harm ocd and suicide ideation. I’ve been trying to get a higher level of mental health care because the counselor I speak with on the phone isn’t really equipped to deal with amount of issues I have.

269636,"Seriously contemplating death since a few weeksHi everyone  

  

First of all, obligatory throwaway.  

  

I left university in 2018 and decided to leave my west european country for an african one to find a job, which I did. I truly loved this whole situation, but I ended up burning out because of the sheer amount of required work for a shitty pay.  

  

After my burnout, I came back to my parents in Europe. And I'm back to round 1 now, except I had some time to think about my life and where I am at. It's not exactly a unique path I've taken. But here's the thing, I don't have any passion. I don't have any burning desire for anything. I started running a year ago before I was officially diagnosed with depression due to an excess of stress and a predisposition (I never liked to consider myself ""depressed"" but always felt that there was something I didn't have in life..).  It helps, but it's not enough, and before that I was never really sportive. It's more of a recreative thing.  

  

Back at University I took classes based on what I like - Languages, law, and further down the road I specialized in wine trade. Everything was fine until I realized all of them would lead me towards unaccomplishing jobs. If you thought wine is overrated, wait until you work there. Everybody becomes extremely uptight and overprotective of a label put on a bottle, which is, after all, just a drink. Same goes for tourism, event management... and for the latter you get to erase any boundaries between your professional and private lives, because of how weird the hours can get.

If it was just that, perhaps that would be fine - but people do it for shitty pay. You don't just get paid enough. Or rather, you get paid just enough. I am an extremely low maintenance person, so I started saving half of my salary every month. But for what? Any significant purchase like housing will never be in my reach. If I start buying a car, I will simply not be able to save anymore - be it to insure it, repair it and put fuel in it.   

  

So it just puts my salary in perspective. If I work my ass off to the point I destroy my mental health, I should at least get paid a respectable amount? Especially with my qualifications? (I am postgrad). So, if I don't , why would I work so much? But that's not how it works when you get some responsibilities.  

  

Because I travelled so much, I barely have any good friends left. To be honest, there's just my parents, who are the only people I really care about. But other than that, life is just taking me too much energy. I like running, but that's all I have left. I am not a good consumer, because I don't care about the latest high tech, equipment, food, I don't care about fashion..  

  

Obviously if I dig outside of my tiny bubble there's also the current environmental and political global issues.   

  

I'm not used to open up about this at all, it's probably the first time I ever do. But it's the first time that I actually consider killing myself. I have never really been afraid of the idea of being dead, more of the transition from life into death.  

  

I am under medication (10mg citalopram per day) since september but that doesn't seem to do anything. I'll sure go see somebody soon, but I obviously don't know what I'll ever be able to change in my life to change these things because of how much they define me..

333170,"I'm not going to make it.
I've posted on reddit, on various forums quite a lot lately. 

Nothing gets better for me. Every day is worse than the last.

I am 30 years old, that might be important here.

I am currently halfway through a very expensive and high-quality program of therapy, which uses a variety of techniques, including CBT, Hypnotherapy, and EMDR (eye movement desenitisation reprocessing). The quality of the therapy is excellent, the therapist really goes the extra mile, plenty of follow up contact, uniquely handwritten reports and objectives/goals after each session, phone calls every few days to check on progress, etc etc. I have never had a therapist this good before, out of all of the professionals that I have gone to. This is designed to deal with social/generalised anxiety, which is by far my main problem.

However, it really doesn't seem to be making much difference. Of course, I'm not finished yet, and intend to stick with it, but I think I have figured out what's happening.

Firstly, there is no ""transformation"" possible for me. Therapy, whatever type it is, doesn't change the person that you are. It doesn't take a deeply depressed, antisocial, anxious, broken person and turn them into a happy, cheerful, confident party animal. That's not possible, because that isn't the person that I am.
The best case scenario is that I make very slow progress, gradually doing a little more here, and a little more there. This is just not enough for me. I am severely limited in my life. I took a bus alone for the first time at 27 or something, I went abroad for a holiday for the first time at 29. I ate in a restaurant for the first time at 29 as well. This is embarassing, but when I went to college for the first time, I used to brush my teeth in my bedroom and spit the toothpaste out the window because I didn't want to risk running into someone on the stairs. THAT'S how bad I am. Slow, gradual progress will not work fast enough for me, and unfortunately, that's the only way. There is no quick fix here, there is no eureka moment, just a long, long battle. It would take me many years to even get to be barely functional, if I can even be functional at all.

The second thing I have realised is that with any kind of illness, or issue in life, there are two ways that it can go. You can have issues that you can work through, and overcome, and you can have issues that you just have to accept. For example, my dad hurt his knee badly when he was young. He has had to have several surgeries on it over the years, and it still causes him issues, but he has managed to live a full life despite it, he can walk, he can climb stairs, it doesn't really affect his day to day life that much. However, years ago when he was a kid, he was very good at football, and there was a chance he could possibly go pro, or semi pro. His doctor looked at his xrays after the accident and asked him: ""Are you good at school?"" ""No"" he said. ""Get good at it, because you are never going to be an athlete"". Due to the nature of the injury, it just wasn't possible for him to become an athlete, he just had to accept that, and cope with it.
I have learned that I just have to cope with being alone. I have tried harder to find someone than I have tried to do anything else in my life. I honestly have, and I am still completely alone. Totally, completely, alone. I get pains, physical pains, when I think of the people in my life that I allowed myself to care for. They have all rejected me, and forgotten me, and I wanted so much to be a part of their lives. I wanted to have a life with them, and matter to them. I know now that due to my issues, that will never happen.

I cannot move on. I know I *should* but I just can't... These people meant so much to me. One person in particular. I will never ""get over"" her. She was very special to me. 

I have been told many times that I am ""Not ready"" for a relationship, and I have to admit, much as it terrifies me, that they are right. I am not ready for a relationship, and it will be a very, very long time before I am, if I am ready at all. Even with all the therapy in the world, I will be pushing 40 before I'm ready to date for the first time. Imagine how much LIFE I have missed. Ca you imagine? A young man at 30, having never experienced what it's like to have friends, or be with a woman? Knowing it will be at least 5-10 years before you even have a CHANCE at experiencing that?? 

Even then, think about the odds against me! An inexperienced late-30s early 40's guy with mental health issues trying to compete with normal guys?? Even if I could compete, my heart is not in it. I mean I just can't start another conversation with ""Hi, how are you? What kind of music do you like? Oh yeah, me too, I love that band!"" I just... I just can't... I'm 30 years old, I just can't go through that for the 10,000th time and hope that THIS ONE TIME will be different from all the others...

Being honest, I can, and likely will, continue to make progress. I think I could learn to drive, eventually. With my lack of confidence and anxiety it will likely take several years, but I think I could eventually get a drivers licence. I think I could travel. I have done a very very small amount of travelling, so I have proven that it is possible for me. I think I could build on that, and see a little more of the world. I think I could maybe do a few more of my bucket list things, I've had a list for a while.
But those things bring me no pleasure. None. I feel numb. I travel alone. I see movies alone. I go out for meals alone. I do everything alone, and I feel no pleasure. None... 

I cannot and will not live my life alone, and that leaves me with no other option than to commit suicide.

So that's it.

I'll be finished this course of therapy early in the new year, and then I think I'll do it. I don't know where I'm going to get the courage, but that's what the therapy is secretly for, to give my the courage to die. 

I wish I could have felt love before I died. That's all I really wanted. Even when I was a kid, that's all I wanted. I remember I used to keep little bits of jewellery and trinkets that I got in christmas crackers and toys in a box. I was going to give them to my first girlfriend when I met her. I used to write letters to my future girlfriend, I was so sure... I was so so sure there was someone out there for me. I never lost faith, and then... I did...

I don't know what I would have done if I had known then that I would never find anyone...

I have a lot of anxiety caused by trying to save as much money as possible because i fear losing my job or illness and either one would be devastating to the point where I could be homeless.  I don's have any friends. I hat my job, but don't have the money to go back to school for a better one (I have a humanities BA).  I bought a house 2 years ago, and am never home to enjoy it because I work 50-60 hours a week.  My boyfriend and family nag at me to dress nicer and ""spend more time on myself"" and they say its because I'm attractive.  Before I was being hounded with these comments I actually had pretty decent self esteem, but now I feel like i do not look age appropriate or acceptable without nice clothes (which i do not want to spend my precious few dollars on) or makeup (which i don't mind, but only wear once a week or so).  When I was a teenager, I thought it was awesome to be a girl.  IT felt like times had changed and girls were equal! However as I have grown older, I hate being a woman.  I feel limited in my earning power.  I would love to have a child some day but cannot fathom how I'd be able to (financially) take care of one on my own and still keep up the work schedule I need.  I don't feel I could ever trust anyone to be supportive of me financially because I've been ""independent"" for so long.  My boyfriend is a foreign national and planning to move to his home country in about a year.  He would like me to go with him and says that there's enough money where I wouldn't have to work, but the thought of that terrifies me.  I can't imagine having to ask someone for money to buy tampons and food.  Also, going with him would mean sacrificing everything I've worked for, which right now is basically just my house.  But the house is very important to me because it's my only validation that I'm not a sloth person.  Look, MY house.  I bought it. Myself.   But I feel like I'm going to end up alone in my house, squirreling away nuts and talking to my dog.  I feel like I'm stuck in a dichotomy where i can either keep my ""independence"" and live a hair away from poverty and ruin or I can gussy up and submit to the patriarchy so i can be more stable, but tied to the whims of someone else who as the main breadwinner gets more ""say"".  I just can't relax, ever.  I constantly tired. I feel lazy because I don't exert more energy into bettering my life, learning new things, doing new things, seeing new places.  When I think of a vacation, my dream is to sleep 14 hours a day and have my dog bring me breakfast when I wake up.  maybe go swimming.  That's all the desire I have left.  I don't even care to feel physically well to the point where if I'm hungry and don't have immediate access to something appetizing at the moment, I just don't eat.  Some days all I eat is a bowl of granola.  I don't feel deserving of the energy because it would be wasted on me or i would waste it doing things that don't bring me joy, like finding a second bullshit job. My immune system is tanking. I'm constantly getting canker sores in mu mouth and they hurt, and are another reason I don't eat much as they make it uncomfortable.

61714,"I don't know what to doSo I am currently living with family because of online school. It's been hell. I knew being back home would be bad, but I didn't think it would get this bad. 

 I remember in the weeks leading to my leaving for school I noticed a real change in my mood. While I was away, my mental health improved a lot.  Before I left, I had a self-harm issue from 2015-18. It's hard to pin down the cause as I never could go get help. I am from a family where we all grew up taking our emotions out on each other. I guess my mother and sibling were physically abusive (I grew up with it being pretty normal to be hit even I didn't do things). It stopped as my mother became to old.  I was too afraid to seek help when I started to get suicidal thoughts because I did not want to be committed or have it affect any applications I might submit. I thought I could manage it, but there would days I couldn't feel anything. I started self harming. 

I attempted suicide twice 3 years ago. Since the method I used was painful and ineffective, I didn't succeed and managed to hide it. I haven't attempted since then, and I have avoided self harm that was as severe since then. I'd dig my nails into my skin til it bruised every now and then, but it wasn't scarring so I thought was fine. 

My family  situation seemed to improve, but then took a drastic dip after I left because my father came back. He's not physically abusive. But he is financially abusive and very manipulative. Everyone is on edge and tiptoes around him. It's actually gotten worse in the last few months, and I am having suicidal thoughts again. I didn't think it would get this bad since routine verbal abuse and threats of violence  isn't something I'm dealing with now.  Like I'm not being screamed at for minor things so it's fine. But I'm having suicidal thoughts again. There are days when I barely eat.  Since I have attempted it in the past, I don't think I could go to professional without being labeled high risk. I don't even know if I could go to therapist. I don't know where to go. I'm codependent on my family as I have little savings, which I acknowledge is my own fault. I don't have a job right now. Maybe it's better if I went through with it and tried something more fool proof. It'd be the first time I actually took charge of my life.",depression

Even though on a surface level it appears as if I've succeeded in life, my success with girls is ridiculously terrible. I know it seems immature that my suicidal thoughts are based on that but just let me continue. Ever since I was a kid I tried to put myself out there romantically with girls, but literally every time I feel like I might actually find someone it all comes crashing down. Example(s): Had a crush on a girl for 2 years, asked her out on facebook a year in, she never responded until a few months ago where she accepted. I set up a whole picnic and everything (I thought it was my first date) and we went out for coffee a few times after that. Little did I know she was under the impression that these were ""friend dates"" and basically everything I thought was going right was a lie. This has happened again and again, and even though I keep on trying no matter what nothing seems to go right with my social/romantic life. Every time I feel like I'm finally close to having SOMETHING with anyone, something ridiculous backfires and I'm left in the dust. Either the girl gets a boyfriend while we are seeing each other, or I say something slightly wrong and I never see her again, or something else that is equally stupid. It just feels like the world is out to get me, especially considering that by all accounts I'm pretty attractive and charming. I don't have low self-esteem, but I feel dreadfully lonely almost all the time and I just feel this emptiness/pain in my heart any time I think about the idea of a relationship. This lack of luck has caused me to fall into a pretty deep depression and I feel like my luck will never look up. As I said earlier, I know this is minor especially compared to a lot of these posts but a suicidal thought is a suicidal thought and I just sort of feel hopeless. It is even worse when the girls that I'm friend-zoned with (completely fine with it, not complaining about the friend-zone) continually question why I don't have a girlfriend, saying that it doesn't make sense why girls aren't all over me. All that does is make me feel worse, because it just feels like I can't even change anything anymore. I'm apparently good looking, I dress well, I play the guitar, the piano, and the trumpet, I'm apparently charming, but no matter what I do no girl has ever even looked at me like I'm anything but genderless.

but so many people (females, of which are in the dating pool) are just so horrible and unsympathetic.

on the same note, being alone is just fucking worse man. i rather go through this pain than have not experienced love.

156561,"life is meaningless and everything i expected it to be is a pipe dream. Will it ever change?Since i was 12 i have been suicidal on and off. for various reasons. typically back then it was for very temporary reasons such as bad home life etc so i always told myself to stick it out, wait and see what life has to offer.. i almost committed suicide on December 31, 2013. that was my last attempt. i was 14 at the time. then, a few hours before i executed my diabolical plan, someone reached out to me and showed me actual human compassion and i decided if i wanted to kill myself i would have to wait until December 31, 2014 to do so. Turns out, 2014 was the best year of my pathetic life. The teenage experience was very intense and passionate for me. I had this revelation that if i would have killed myself that night, i would have never experienced those amazing times. But now that i’m past all that, that intense passion for life has left me at least 2 years ago, never to return. I feel like now i see life for what it really is. It’s a black hole of emptiness poverty and responsibility. Everyone around me is pushing me to do something with my life and for what? i don’t see a point in any of it. i have no drive or passion for literally anything. I don’t have hobbies. I don’t want to “spend the rest of my life” doing anything. I just want to enjoy life, that is my goal. And all i see in my future is working paycheck to paycheck. giving money hand over fist for necessities. never actually being able to get to the top of the food chain because i wasn’t born into any of it. i’m a woman. i don’t know shit about shit. i have no talents. I’m pretty but that isn’t going to take me anywhere, and that’s temporary! i’m pretty sure i’ve already found the guy i’m supposed to marry and it isn’t romantic or thoughtful or anything like i have always dreamed of. yes i love him but i don’t think he makes life worth it. nothing personal, i don’t think friends make life worth it either. i don’t think anything or anyone makes life worth it. you can’t trust anyone, nobody really truly cares about you or thinks about you when you’re not around. we are all just fumbling around being fake versions of ourselves trying to make a living and impress other people so we can push ourselves up. and i hate that cycle. i don’t want any of it. i hate the quality of life i was born into. America is supposed to be the land of opportunities but i just see a huge obstacle course sitting in front of me waiting to be ran through and here i am at 20 with people telling me to run towards it but it just seems like more trouble than it’s worth. I didn’t choose to live this life, it was given to me anyways and now i have to work until i die to never really be successful. There’s really no point to it that i can see. I’m too poor to “travel or find something i’m passionate about” it just seems like one big pipe dream to me. is this normal for 20 year olds? i thought my 20s was supposed to be the best years of my life, i did everything my mother told me to do. finished school and didn’t get knocked up, but here i am 100% disappointed and let down with what i hyped myself up to think life would be like. this shit really sucks man. i cry all the time. i feel so fucking alone in the world and it’s getting to the point where it hurts to even think about how alone i really am. i’m naturally really thoughtful and enthusiastic but this world just crushed that shit out of me honestly and now i’m just here existing and it sucks. meds make me a zombie and weed makes me anxious about everything, i don’t find joy in things i used to love. i don’t want to have to do this i really don’t. i want to live and enjoy life but i feel like i’m doing the opposite and yeah people would be upset if i died but maybe they should have showed me a little more of that when i was alive. i’ve been feeling like this for way too long. it fucking sucks.",depression

107851,"Tired and spentI don't think that anyone around me realizes just how serious my apathy is. Everyone hopes that I'm ""just going through a sad stage"", but the truth is that I've always been like this.

I've taught and made myself believe that my sole purpose in life is to suffer. For whom and why, it didn't matter. I just needed to suffer in order to atone for whatever sins I may had done. My guilt and all of my rotten pleasures...

I feel so demoralized and alone in this world. I have yet to meet someone who knows and understands the meaning of causes.

Maybe I've spent too much time alone, but I'm starting to realize just how nihilistic everyone is. I'm starting to see just how people revel in their ironic laughter at their ""values"". To be aware of just how empty their words are, and yet not understand them. It is madness...

I don't know what to do.

Change? I cannot change, it's my best trait. I avoided a fate more horrible than death by not changing for the sake of companionship. You don't have to believe me, and I'm probably making a big fuss about it, but my isolated lifestyle gave me insight into things that the ""socially-trained"" mind cannot pick up. It's what made me a better person, albeit naive.

I loved the idea of an orderly and just society more than I've ever loved myself. I lived most of my life thinking about how I could do my part for the whole. Yet, if I die now, the negative impact on my little world would outweigh any good that I've done.

Yet, I cannot live. I'm too broken. Too insane with dissapointment. Drifting...",depression

228985,"I’m getting too behind in life.I’ve been more frequent then I aught to be about this, but there are some things I just can’t bring myself to do, it’s simply out of character for me. I still end up doing it only to find out I have to do it again, and again, and again. Well, I don’t want to do it anymore, but the longer so stay having not done it, the more miserable I become, the more angry I get. Through each failure, my impulse becomes more intense, from violent anger to extreme sadness and self-loathing, which is why I can’t bring myself to do this anymore, it hurts. My dilemma, that I’ve vented about time and time and time again, is women. Let me be clear in saying I don’t care for a friendship with women, I mean it’s nice, and I can appreciate it, but it isn’t dependent on gender at all, meaning I could have a friendship with practically anybody, and I’m pretty well acquainted, although it’s all guys, because they actually talk to me, and respect my presence. I’ve tried to get the attention of women many times over, I’ve heard a lot from them, “not interested,” “only date black guys,” “already have a boyfriend,” and the most recent one “I’m gay.” I’m just so fucking sick of having to persist so much for something I absolutely need (I’m not exaggerating, you can’t just set this kind of stuff aside with hobbies, you have to confront it and find out if you like it), in a world where persistence is only ok if she likes you and is playing hard to get, when I hear no, I’m not just gonna barge in and say “too bad” and rape the girl, but even if I say something to persist, I feel like I’ll come off as a jerk, actually I already feel like a piece of shit for being practically a fuckboy, but god I’m not just gonna leave afterwards unless the person is utterly terrible, I feel like the sex and kinky stuff is the test to see if I like you, then we do the friendship stuff. Well, as you can see, no hope, I’ll be a virgin until I’m about 24 or so (18 going on 19 in a week), and I’ll be so focused on this for the next few years I’ll be behind in my life. I’m not going to skip sex and come back to it, this isn’t a test, it’s an obstacle, I can’t just “get over it,” I need to have it, so I can say that I have it, diminish its value, throw it away, and move on to the next goal, I don’t mean I’ll be bored from sex, I just mean I won’t have to focus on it any more so I won’t need to worry about it, then I can put more time into code, and when I do, I’ll make some projects that I can sell for good money, but I can’t do any of that when I’m horny every 2 fucking hours, I need to get ahead in what I’m doing, or I’ll just live a mediocre life that isn’t worth living, and I’d rather die than live like everybody else.",depression

I've had a bad childhood but back when i was younger i had a few friends that i stook with for years of school, when college came around i talked less and less and my life got worse and worse.

Someone came into my life and made it the best I've ever felt for 2 years. Those 2 years sadly came to an end a few days ago. I always thought people who were heart broken were overreacting about how much it hurt but fuck i understand it all now. People around me are all so happy and im just tired of it all. I'm trying to hold all this shit in and put on a fake face, but its the hardest shit ever. 

I was depressed before my relationship and it felt so magical like it all went away when i was in it.  Now im not in it I feel worse about myself. I want to eat so much but at the same time i dont want to eat at all, ive never tried suicide because ive never wanted to hurt my mother. fuck im so close to crying now. 

I'm contemplating on not sending this mess because i dont want people to think im doing it for attention, i just want someone to talk to who understands the feelings, i understand i probably wont get any responses because im one of many people who are going through these suicidal thoughts and i cant imagine how people who have been through worse than me are feeling. 

I guess im just at my lowest point in life now but people who keep saying it will get better said that last time and its just getting worse.

There's so much going on in my life...I have trichotillomania, PTSD, depression, and anhidrosis possibly more illnesses...I'm tired of waking up over heated to the point of feel weak and ill the entire day and it happens so often...

I almost died so many times throughout my life....I remember being thrown in the backseat of my mother's car by my mom to protect me from gunshots, being in a fire surrounded by flames with my sisters and my mother, seeing my mother stab my father and his blood everywhere in our bathroom when I was six because he molested my eldest sister....I was also my mother mostly throughout my life...Molested throughout my life...Raped when I was very little....The list goes on....

Despite what has happened, I love my family to bits and pieces.....I have issues with them and feelings of not belonging but I do have fond memories I want to hold on, until the very last moments of my death however I may die.....

 I left my family to move out of state to breathe and find myself so to speak but I barely have contact with them because I am just in a runt and I am dating who lowers my self esteem,etc....Yet he says he cares which is bullshit and he's the only one who knows what I am planning to do...I doubt he would stop me if I actually tried anything...........


No one would........I'm going to start taking walks near the river, putting my feet in the water for a bit to see how it feels.....I'll start taking  baths instead of showers and to hold my breathe underwater to see what it would probably feel like to drown.....

30632,"The thoughts of suicide are back, I seem to be heading towards the mediocre life I've always feared, and I feel like there is no way left to avoid it. help.I've had suicidal thoughts since I was a child, I've constantly felt like something was wrong about my relationship with others, I'm not sure if it's anger, hate or insecurity that has been building up, but there certainly is something.

I have 26 years, I've always been perceived as a timid person, and sometimes a weak person, easy to take advantage of. My self perception is different, though, I know the things I have, like a decent job, not bad looks, ok intelligence, three languages, fantastic friends, an amazing family which never left me on my own; actually all of the people that surround me and that get to know me love me, and I also feel intense love for all of them; most people I know actually, I believe in giving a chance to everyone to prove they're good people.

But my problem is that no matter what I do people perceive me as weak, and mostly in competitive environments, I tend to be stepped on because I have never learned how to claim what's mine, or at least make it apparent that I am confident.

I always tried to make the right decisions, staying in school, working, being obedient, being nice to people I may have perceived want to hurt me... and well, all that and even half of the efforts I am making would make me a successful person, but this one thing, psychiatrists have called social anxiety, or that I have called cowardice have caused me to have to work double in order to get the same recognition someone who knows how to ""sell"" himself gets.

The work I got I got it because of my father, and once I got the chance I gave everything I could tomake the best of it, and I have done great things, then again people with better relatinos more ""secure"" have gone ahead of me doing half the effort. Right now I'm finishing my master's degree.... but I don't feel it's an achievement, as I doubt it'll change my condition and professional expectations.

And I have tried to do several things about that, I've gone to psychologists, read self-help books, gotten into theater lessons, dancing lessons, leadership lessons, oral expression courses, coaching, animal therapy... you name it. But it's still the same, I have found no reason for my personality, and therefore no ""cure"". Also, I don't wat to become an asshole that deceives people, I just want to show what I've got to give to them (positive things actually!).

Anyway, I don't mean to say that ""the world is missing out on me"". What hurts me is that people near me like my parents or my brother love me and would hate to see me suffer, but I know there is no way out of a lifetime of living mediocrily, underappreciated because of my on fault, what I want to get rid of is an essential part of me; that's why at this moment it seems like it all must go.

I don't want to live like this, I know people love me, and I love them back, but it's about me, I dont want a life in which I know the only thing that's stopping me has no solution. I know this sounds like a childish issue, and yes, many people have greater problems; but I feel like I'm on the edge of a downward spiral, where to cope with my life I will need drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, taking it out on someone else being abusive... which is why it will be better to end everything as it is, not doing anymore harm.

To keep my family and friends from pain, I'm planning to go secretly, tell them I'm going to travel somewhere nice, away from civilization to find peace, then I'll strand off to an even more remote place where no one will find my body and breathe some helium or nitrogen to sleep.

1.) I am not old enough to purchase what I need in order to do it.
2.) I don't have anywhere secluded to go to do it.

For these reasons, the chances of me surviving and/or being found and taken to the hospital are far too high. I want to make sure I will die without any chance of rescue. Can't risk it. I don't want to ATTEMPT, I want to SUCCEED.

103464,"15 years old and life disgusts meA lot of suicides are in an either direct result of someone hating their life, or a suicidal influence from a tramautic event or series of, combined with depressed thoughts. Let's get this on the table now - my life is better than a lot of people's. I'm a sophomore in high school yet I attend university, my parents have a combined 180k salary and I'm an 8/10 and I'm not short or fat or anything, I'm a well built 5'11 150 pounds. I've lost a lot of friends recently and I have a fucking asshole piece of shit of a father who hits me, my brother, and tries to hit my mom (that's why I get hit - defending her) and he's always yelling about how he hates his life and us. But fuck it. I've learned to let it go after a lot of years of bullshit. I just got out of a 14 month relationship (which is concurrent with my parents' divorce) but that's not the reason I feel this way. How do I kill myself and make it look like an accident?

I've felt this way since around October of 2014, when I was 15 years old and 3 months old. To put it quaintly, I thought a lot about life and growing up and the world and I just fuckin hate everything. I don't care anymore and yes I'm sane. It's just that the more I live life the more I hate it. Material possession and experiences (family and friends) have just lost their touch. I've lost interest in all activities, daily and annually.",depression
281535,"I'm a mistake that I don't have the confidence to fix anymoreI don't even feel human. What kind of god would have made me like this and expect things to be okay? Dysthymia with poorly timed severe depression, anxiety, PTSD, and now we're throwing in an adulthood diagnosis of autism. (It explains a lot, which is nice, but it's daunting to think I'll have zero social skills for the rest of my life.) I've been stuck like this for nearly ten years. I'm on autopilot 24/7 just to get by, and if my attention slips I burst into tears.

Some of the hardest things:
- My family doesn't understand mental illness at all
- If I go back to a ward I'd probably lose my job, future chance at careers, and the only person who loves me
- If I die I also lose the only person who loves me (but hey no more working)
- The plans for my last attempts, although deleted, are too fresh in my mind

And now realizing,
- Everyone here has been through so much. I feel like a wimp. I'm so ready to die, but what for? What's making me feel like this lately? Not much.

Things have been so good lately. What's wrong with me? Am I just permanently broken? Did I lose the ability to be happy no matter what good comes my way?

I am happy sometimes, often even. Why doesn't it stay? Even when nothing changed between last night and today but my own thoughts, why do I want to die again?

It's just been happening so much lately. I can't take it anymore. This shit eating goblin in my brain wants me dead and god dammit I just might have to give it to him to shut him up.

264695,"[Rant] Stop shaming people for being ""homophobes"" There's one thing that people need to understand, and it's that not everyone is going to agree with certain lifestyles or ideaologies, and homosexuality is one of them. I agree that we should try to tolerate it with the best of our ability, but not everyone is going to accept it. Which brings me to my main point; stop shaming people for being ""homophobes"" just because they disagree with the LGBT community. Unlike what others may lead you to believe, as long as you're not a jerk about it, being a ""homophobe"" does not make you a shitty person, it just means you have a different set of beliefs. It's also worth noting that finding gay people making out disgusting doesn't make you homophobic. By that logic, sex-repulsed aroaces are the most bigoted beings out there. 

Just like you can't convince a homosexual to be straight, you can't convince everyone to accept an ideology, especially one of controversial nature.

132551,"I survived - and I am glad I didSo on 19th June I overdosed with meds that I was certain would kill me (and Dr. confirmed that they would've). I had the funeral arranged, I had set back my computers, cancelled all memberships. I was 100&amp;#37; certain I wanted to do it at that moment. I took the pills and layed on my bed. After 1.5 hours i noticed some effects setting in (from my research the lethal dosage should kill me within max. 4 hours). And I thought to myself ""if I don't do anything now, I am going to die"". And I don't know why but I called 112. I told them what I took and they came and sedated me.

I woke up on Friday 22th with a feeding tube, catheters, they told me I had to have a lung intubation and I was just miserable. Until today, 29th I was in a psyche ward and today I was allowed to go home.

And I am happy I survived. I've always read about people who e.g. try to hang themselves and when they are close to dying realize they don't want to. I couldn't imagine that happening to me. 

I am in a certain way also happy I tried, because I know that I actually want to live even though I have suicidal thoughts (that still were present in the last week, but I am absolutely not going to attempt it again, neither with medication or anything else). I don't want to die, but I want to change my life in a way that I do not feel like this anymore. I am getting into a specialized facility as soon as I get a place.

323074,"I can't take keep battling these constant suicidal thoughts, at verge of going through with it.From the moment I wake up, I feel anxious, depressed, suicidal and have a horrible feeling that goes through the pit of my stomach. 

I'm 30 years old now, and I've been suffering from depression since I was a little girl. My mother had PTSD, BPD and drug addiction problems, and tried to kill herself multiple times. A couple of those times I was the one who actually found her after she slit her wrists, stabbed herself in the stomach etc. and I had to be the one to call the police, while trying to stop the bleeding (very hard thing for a kid to handle). Eventually my dad divorced her for our sake, but when I visited her she would get high, throw full cans of soda at my head, let her grown friends make fun of me, and was just terrible. She even did coke with me when I was 15, because she's fucking nuts. All of this led to multiple suicide attempts throughout my childhood and adolescence.

My dad tried his best, but he was a constantly working single father, and didn't know how to deal with it. He tried to get me help by sending to psychiatrists, but all they did was shove pills down my throat, and it made me angry. I dropped out of high school, although I eventually got my diploma at 19 via correspondence.

I had some low paying retail jobs throughout my teens, until I decided at 20 to move to Los Angeles be closer to the music I loved (it was the only thing that gave my life meaning). I moved in with my grandfather, however the city was so overwhelming and crowded I could barely go anywhere. I made it around to a few shows and clubs to be around music, but everyone was incredibly shallow. I tried a couple of jobs, but they didn't last long because I had severe panic attacks.

Eventually I tried to go back to school, started dating, started going to a local mental health clinic, until I was raped by a boyfriend at the age of 24. I was throwing up so violently after that, that I had to drop out of school, and go on disability to help pay for things around the house.

I kept going to the mental health clinic, but none of the medications helped. I've lost track of how many I tried, but it's at the very least 30. The clinic put me in a DBT mindfulness program, and I absolutely hated it. There were a lot of silly acronyms, it was confusing, and I just didn't want to do it. When I asked if I could just try individual talk therapy they got angry, offended and basically refused. If I wanted treatment, I would be forced to participate in this program against my will, so I just left.

Then last year, I stopped pretty much leaving my house. I think a combination of all the trauma and stress and the copious amounts of pot I was smoking led me to have some sort of psychotic breakdown. It was like I died, and I feel like I was in some sort of purgatory or hell. I was believing all sorts of crazy things, and then I started hearing a really abusive voice. It would berate me 24/7, and actually control my body. It would say things like ""I'm going to stop your heart bitch"" and then my heart would actually constrict in pain. There's a whole lot more I won't get into, but it was like being psychologically and physically tortured for six months straight, every waking hour of the day.

Eventually I became more stable on my own (came back to reality, and stopped hearing the voice), but the whole thing has left me feeling more damaged, traumatized and depressed than I already was. I can't even take basic care of myself.

Not only that but my grandfather is 90 now, and I haven't worked in almost 10 years and I've been on disability for nearly 5 years. When he dies, the house goes to the bank because of a reverse mortgage, so I'll probably be homeless. Even if I miraculously managed to get well, who the hell is going to give me a job?

I've basically given up all hope on life. I've given up on ever being well and having some sense of a good life. Of ever being in love or having a job. Or even having some sense of dignity (I don't even feel like a person anymore). I don't want to go back to that clinic, because they weren't helping before, so why would they help now. I don't want to play medication roulette, and be forced into therapy programs I don't like against my will. 

After a lifetime of shit, all I have to look forward to is the possibility of homelessness. Just when I think it can't get worse, it does, so I figure why not just end it now before my suffering gets worse? There's no point.",depression
266293,"A story of self-sabotage, lies, loneliness and a unhappy endingI'm a 25 year old female at my wits end. I'm entirely unlikable, and this has been proven true a countless times. It's not like I haven't attempted to make connection with others. In the past, I've made an effort in person and online but no one seems to be able to tolerate me and to be honest, I don't blame them. People are nice when I pretend to be someone else, but never when I'm myself.

I calculated that I may be compatible with 5% of the 8 billion out there and it is really getting to me. This unease is also fuelled by the fact that I met someone a few years ago who was most likely my soulmate, even though I don't necessarily believe in that stuff. He was just like me and we got along without words. But my insecurities took over and I assumed he was just humouring me, I ended up being cold and he left. I only realized what I had done when I re-read our old text logs and saw that he sent me numerous attempts to engage in a relationship - which I did not acknowledge out of stupidity or maybe because I self-sabotage a lot. Being happy feels foreign to me, so I prefer the misery. Despite not talking with him anymore, I check his blog a lot. And I see that he is happy. Which should make me happy but it doesn't. 

I often fantasize about what could have been. It is a coping mechanism I've had since I was a child. Oh, and I previously stated that I'm unlikeable, one of the reasons is because I lie a lot, often unintentionally. I am trying to correct it but it is hard. My parents think that I am at college and they send me money for my fees but they have no idea that I'm actually not studying.
I know I should come clean but my parents are my only support system and I don't know where to go from here. I can't picture a future because in the past 5 years, nothing has changed despite me trying. I wonder if someone is reading this, and maybe can relate. Maybe I am trying to reach out for a sign. Maybe you've been like this but recovered, maybe that would give me the necessary drive.",depression

DO NOT KILL YOURSELF. Want to know why? Any story is a tragedy. IF YOU LET IT BE. If you could find it in yourself to give a flying shit about anyone else in the world you can read below.

I don't expect any of you almost dead people to give a fuck.

I barely give a fuck about me.

I am a 32 year old female. I am engaged to a man. I have no children. I have young siblings that I raised. 

I just visited this subreddit for the first time tonight.

Most of you seem to be teenagers or young adults in high school or college. That doesn't mean to discount these feelings and experiences, but this is normal.

EVERY TEENAGER FEELS SUICIDAL. I felt that way every day. My parents were horrible. My first love didn't even break up with me. He just didn't talk to me again. So in silence I listened to Tori Amos and contemplated suicide. I was a straight A student yet took a bunch of pills and stayed home. 

WE ARE ALL THE SAME!

I used my period as an excuse. I obviously didn't succeed. My friends at the time also felt that way. WE FELT SUICIDAL AT 20-29 as well. EVERYONE FEELS THAT WAY. We all curse and do drugs and don't give a flying fuck about our terrible families. THAT IS NORMAL. BLAH BLAH BLAH.

At this age, you start to realize your parents are full of shit. Your uncles, aunts, cousins, are full of shit. Society sucks and it's all shit. OF COURSE IT IS! So get used to it. But DON'T KILL YOURSELF! Why? I thought about it many times. BUT WHY DO IT?

This is a taboo topic in the United States at least. But I want you to know that these feelings will pass. They come up now and then for me. I may be more well adjusted now as a 32 year old, but I still feel my dad raping me and still have nightmares. Those types of reasons for killing yourself don't just disappear.

I used to eat my lunch in bathroom stalls. And dream about slitting my wrists in high school and college. But now I am a successful woman in NYC.

249816,"I missed two online classes today. So basically, I was doing all virtual classes this year until Monday of this week. Now I'm in hybrid classes, which means I'm in a group that goes to school on Mondays and Thursdays and stays virtual for the rest of the week. There are two other groups, one group goes to school on Tuesdays and Fridays, and the other that stays virtual the entire week. Today is the only day that all groups are virtual. 

Before Monday, classes started at 9 AM. Since I had study hall for my first period, I started classes at 10 AM. Now, first period starts at 7:30, meaning I start at 8:34. For some reason, I thought that since today was the only all virtual day, the classes would follow the prior virtual schedule. I was wrong obviously. At the time my first class started, I was on the road to my mother's house with my Dad. 

I only realized my mix up 30 minutes ago when I tried logging into my 2nd period Google Meeting. There was no code posted so I asked my friend from the class what was up. That's when I found out for sure that I had missed an entire class. 

I have a solution though, I'm gonna email the teachers of the classes that I missed and tell them that I had technical difficulties. I'll finish the work that I need to do first, then I'll email. Fortunately, both the teachers are pretty chill and I think they'll understand. I would tell them the truth but then if my mother finds out she'll scream, yell and, threaten me like she always does.

35296,"Subconciously trying to kill myselfI've tried to kill myself once in the past and I have a history of hurting myself to deal with intense stress.

I'm living with intense stress for extended periods of time now, I keep myself from hurting me, but as a result I react in weird, self-harming ways and I'm afraid it'll end up turning me into a cripple and possibly hurting innocent people.

I like riding my bike and recently I occassionaly have the urge to kill myself popping into my head. Like not slowing down while driving towards a crossroads. It could be so easy...

Then there's moments where I subconciously disregard my safety, pick pointless fights etc. 

Just an hour ago I almost got hit by a car, the car owner was a little shocked and pretty mad and when he yelled, asking whether or not I want to fucking die, the answer in my mind was ""Yeah I guess so"".

Not always are other people involved, sometimes I may just be on a mountain road heading downhill and considering not hitting the brakes. This already happened once and I ended up breaking my right arm and hand with abrasions and bruises all over my body. The medics were pretty surprised my head was unscathed which seems to have been pure luck or maybe survival instinct idk.



TL:DR
I'm resisting the urge to kill or hurt myself but I regularly experience brief moments where I conciously or subconciously expose myself to great danger.

I'm afraid to end up harming other people or ending up as a cripple rather than dead.",depression

So many years of praying and begging and hoping and I don't feel anyone is there. Yet I'm still scared to kill myself. I looked up a few methods and can either do it with a rope and doorframe, a gun, or some gas. Why am I still afraid? 

I'm feeling utterly consumed with hatred and anger and darkness lately. I feel so unlike myself. Saying and thinking and doing things that are so extremely dark and mean and angry. Yet I go to kill myself and suddenly I'm scared again. I want the pain and anger and sorrow to hype me up to get it over with but each time I get scared I'll go to hell. I wanted God to be real my whole life, but after all I have begged for and no help? How can believe. And if I don't believe why am I still scared of hell? If hell doesn't exist what happens if I die? If God and hell are real does it mean that even God has left me like everyone else?

254962,"Falling Back to Bad ThoughtsWell, hello SW. I figure I need to entertain the part of me that says just hold on, but I need someone to talk to. I've been to this point several times before, but each time I would rationalize living for certain people or pass out just purely emotionally taxed.  

The last time was a year ago and I decided I would live for my two best friends. They were a couple of the only people who made me truly happy, and I would do anything for them to make them happy as to return the favor. 

There are so many things wrong that I've done in the past, terrible things I've said, mistake after mistake, more than I have the will to share.  To boil it down, I came to the realization that I was feeling a little too much for one of those friends and hating the other, they were in a relationship and I acted stupidly at the whim of my own selfish rationale. 

After my stupid action, I discussed my feelings and apologized prompting my leaving them. I decided I needed to stay away from them, they deserve far better.  Over the course of the next month, it really started to sink in. 

I've driven everyone I care about away, leaving me by myself. I have parents who love me, I know I can apply myself to my studies, but I stopped trying about a year ago. I realized, what's the point if I'm just going to end up ending it eventually? I was in a bad place, and stopped going to classes, I'd end up just sitting there, contemplating my own existence all class, on the verge of tears, frustrated with myself for being this way, WHY THE FUCK could I just not get over it.

What's the point, if everyone I've tried to be close to or even start something with, I either push away or just get pushed away? I've tried dating quite a few times but I always end up just stopping abruptly before anything can really begin. 

I've been prone to these bouts of depression many times before, and I usually just hold out for better and push through. But this time, it's different. Why should I bother living if I can only subject myself to repeated failure. At this point in my life (early twenties) I have potential, but I can never use it for anything more than hurting those I love. I think I should just hurt them all one final time.",depression

275129,"So my ex texted me yesterday. This is mostly a rant. She believes we are friends. She asked to be friends and I said I would be friends, but really, talking to her gets me really worked up emotionally. I made a few posts a while back explaining the whole thing. That would add context, but this is a rant, and I'll do what I want with or without context.

I said we could be friends, but she did say when we broke up that she would get me back. She texted me a youtube video of a guy doing s cover on the ukelele of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,"" and if you like Monty Python, you'll know what that is. She knew I liked that song. 

I got a new phone a while back and never added her number back into my phone, hoping it would help to move on to not be able to see our past conversations. It really did. She said some things to me when I broke up with her that made me realize that she really didn't want what was best for me. I know what is best for me, and it is not to pretend to love a gender I don't. I could have loved her. I would not have been physically attracted to her, but I would have loved her, but she said she needed sex. Too much pressure. I was in that fucking relationship for way too long. Too much stress on me. That was the closest I've ever been to ending it, and I am not. Fucking. Going. Back. 

If she texted me before valentine's day, does that mean that she is trying to get me back? I'm in a happy relationship just trying to move on with my fucking life, and here it is. Things were just going too fucking okay huh? 

I'm not lesbian. I tried to change for her because she always mentioned how much she loved me, but how much she needed sex and how depressed she was. Fuck I thought if I could just fake it, maybe I could truly change for her and be happy, but I couldn't. I know now that no one should change for anyone. 

The thing is, she has sensitive information of mine, and I'm so fucking scared she is going to send it around if I don't play along. What if she blackmails me into getting back together with her? I'm scared. I never should have trusted her or anyone.

She uses a certain painless method that requires a certain item. On some occasions, she's told me to remove the item from the trunk of her car and get rid of it for her. Recently, I found the item in the trunk of her car again. I tried to get rid of it, but she found out and made me put it back. Earlier in the relationship, I would have refused, but I'm so exhausted. I've spent so much energy trying to get her not to commit suicide, but each time it seems more hopeless. And I'm so worried that eventually I'm just going to be okay with that. It's beginning to feel more and more like she just needs to get it over with. She's in so much pain from flashbacks, physical memories, and panic attacks on an almost daily basis.

We spent months and thousands of dollars seeing a couple psychologists and trying EMDR therapy, but she did not respond favorably to it. Like I said, it just feels sometimes like the end of the line. It feels like I'm just buying time each time I convince her that the joy of life outweighs the pain of her mental disorder. I don't want to give up on her, but it's so exhausting and I can feel myself beginning to get mentally fatigued to the point of accepting that suicide is an option for her.

Please understand that I've never loved anyone as much as I love her, which is part of why it's so concerning that I'm seeing suicide as a viable option for her.",depression

I am seriously thinking about suicide and I can't stop thinking about it. I am not considered to be ""cool"" but that's not the most of my problems. I am treated with such disrespect by people I care about and nobody takes my feelings in to account. I am always written off as being ""too sensitive"" and I am just dismissed. Everyone wants to know what's wrong, nobody wants to help. Everyone just wants to go on and live their lives and leave me behind unless they want something. I am so pathetic that I give them what they want just so they'll pay attention to me for that little bit. I am so pathetic and when I try to stand up for myself and be strong, people tell me I'm being bitchy. I'm so sick of dealing with this on a daily basis I just want to end it.

207032,"No point in tryingI don’t even want to go on trying. I’ve been too tired to function for 5 years now, I’ve had to give up my dream career because I can’t compete with healthy people. My doctor doesn’t think I’m unhealthy enough to qualify for ODSP, but the thought of trying to work the kind of job I could get with my skills makes me want to kill myself even more. My boyfriend thinks I get upset over everything, and was literally laughing at me earlier today when I complained that something he said felt objectifying. I can’t get compliments out of him without dragging them out practically by force, which feels both abusive on my part and in-genuine on his, unless it’s something about how fat I am (apparently he likes that). I’m been in my undergrad for 5 years now, and I have yet to get through a semester where I haven’t had to ask for an extension, not to mention I’m taking a part time course load so nothing I actually do achieve feels like it’s my own. It’s a shitty major anyway, that will never get me a job, even to the point where people laugh at me for having thought that getting an arts degree would actually be useful for anything anyway. My body is the wrong shape, too masculine, and nothing I can ever do will change that. I never succeed at anything I do with anything like the competence I need, even to the point where I honestly don’t believe anymore that I’m capable of succeeding in anything – everyone is always faster, smarter, prettier, more knowledgeable, funnier, more creative, more energetic, more stable… People almost never reach out to me, and seem uncomfortable when I try to reach out to them. I’m a useless waste of oxygen and I just haven’t got the strength to go on telling myself differently when the whole world (except maybe my counselor) seems intent on proving to me just how worthless I really am. Even if I wanted an extension on my assignments at this point, it’s so close to the end of the semester they couldn’t grant one to me. I don’t have the money, time, energy, or willpower to properly take care of myself, and even getting out of bed is… well I don’t want to, I don’t want to have to face another miserable fucking day on this planet. Christians tell me that I’m an aberration against god and that I’m going to hell because I defied his plan for me (by changing gender) – well, I’m already IN hell, it can’t possibly be any worse than this, and what kind of a god does that to people anyway? Society is so fucked up with people campaigning against rights and freedoms (see Stephen Harper, Vic Toews, the entire conservative caucus bursting into laughter at the idea that trans-people deserve equal rights, not to mention Romney getting almost half the American vote, the Golden Dawn party in Greece, unemployment in Spain, legalized murder for being different in Uganda…) I don’t want to be with a guy who dislikes me, but then I’m left with no-one at all.",depression

291830,"What's the point? (15M)This is my first time posting on Reddit and this is a throwaway account, so I apologise for any errors made and this will be a long post.

When I was younger, I always remembered my parents arguing. Whilst not abusive, my Dad grew up in a complicated family with a lot of siblings whose parents didn't pay much attention to him and his Dad wasn't the nicest, this led to him becoming enstranged and didn't see him until he died. Because of my Dad's line of work, he cannot seek therapy for this and my parents have been divorced as of Janurary. Everytime I try to talk to him about my problems he doesn't know how to deal with them. This has led me to have an unhappy upbringing and has also impacted my sister. 

As of the last few years, I have come to think of my life as meaningless and I have developed suicidal thoughts. I currently see an organisation but I was put into a group that didn't help me and counselling sessions always get switched or ended before they actually help. I have been patient but the pnly way out appears to be, A) Medication, or B) Suicide. Even after my death I doubt that I would be seen as anything more than a statistic ignored by them and not a wake up call to improve their service. 

At school people do seem to care about me a lot and a good amount seem to know my name. But I often question if anyone would actually miss me or if I would be forgotten. I only feel like people actually care enough to talk to me when I'm in one of my episodes because they enjoy having me around and feel like people only keep me around for their benefit because if these organisations did care they would give me medicine or they would just let me go. Along with a complicated situation with someone else and I just have no clue why I'm here or what to do. 

I don't know if anyone will really reply to this post or not but I don't know what else there is.

186441,"I can't see the point in living anymore...?I'm 23. I got a law degree at a reasonable university. After getting that degree I realised that for the previous 8 or 9 years (since I was 14) I had been a slave to my own viciously circular thoughts. I had always known it but generally tried to push it to the side. Pretty much everyday I would find myself evaluating the human situation and the value of certain decisions. It always left me thinking that everything is subjective and comes down to a personal account of what is ""good"" and ""fulfilling"". I had been in and out of depression because of these thoughts. They had controlled me. So I decided to channel them, and actually study the mechanisms that allow me to have these thought. I read Darwin, I started studying neuroscience, cognitive psychology, I really wanted to understand *why* I had all of these thoughts, what part of human nature allowed for them, and what made me so damn depressed about them. But it was inevitably this study that led me right back into depression. I found that I couldn't put a value on **anything** anymore. Everything seemed so ridiculously perplexing, like the answers aren't supposed to be known. All of my thoughts were circular. I'd seek fulfilment in one area and then realise that inevitably it wouldn't lead to any significant outcome (mainly because I find it very hard to define ""good""). I guess studying philosophy aswell wasn't a great help.

I don't really know what I'm getting at here, I just typed a whole lot of words. I feel like I need to say this to someone, but kind of feel like the communication is redundant in a way. I wouldn't say I'm *suicidal* (although I have thought about it- but who hasn't?) but I'm just in a stationary state right now and don't know where to go. I have my law degree but have a hard time envisaging myself finding any real sense of self-worth down that career path, let alone *any* career path at all.

I told my counselor that my medications have changed. It caused me to become tired easily, breathless when I don't have the strength to do normal things in my daily routine, dizzy and sleepy when I tried to concentrate on driving.

I also told my counselor that recently I have tried blogging and I am in love with blogging. Yeah! Hope I can make a small side income through blogging :P

I met a stranger online through Reddit. He happened to live in Singapore and we exchanged our handphone numbers. I have decided to go hiking with him on this coming Thursday 7 June 2018. I ask my counselor for help on how to find topics to talk about with him. Yeah, I have mild autism, so I am not very good in social-related things.

In the counseling session, I called my case manager from Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Singapore and told her about the side effects from the new medication I am taking. We decided to come to the outpatient clinic in IMH the next day to inquire about changing medication.

In the counseling session, she also recommended me to go to a place called SG Enable to look for jobs. They will help autistic adults find a job.

After the counseling session, I went to SG Enable. I managed to take off my earphones and ask the receptionist outside as well as the receptionist inside SG Enable. Yeah, I managed to take off my earphones without feeling frightened that people are trying to bully me. The receptionist inside SG Enable said that I will need an official letter from my psychiatrist to certify that I am ok to work. I will work towards this goal by taking part in the empowerment programmes organized by OcTAVE Outpatient Rehabilitation Centre and showing my psychiatrist and my occupational therapist that I am ready to find a job and work.

At evening, I finally came back to my house to relax. What a tiring day! I saw a TV documentary and find out that there are people whose lives are worse than me since they have physical disabilities. It made me realize that compared to them, I am a lot of fortunate and I should not grumble about my fate. I tell myself I am going to become a better person each day.

Some time in the evening, I went out with my mother to buy bread. After I bought the bread and came back to my house, I feel tired easily and breathless again. I am afraid that my new medications have some serious side effects — or are they psychological?

My mother and I went to Accident and Emergency department of IMH. I can't wait anymore. Due to the training during the day (I take off my earphones to talk to people), I became very reliant on my dark glasses and earphones and I become very frightened that people are trying to bully me again. The psychiatrist in the A&amp;E decided to change my medications back. No more new medicine! Back to the old medicine! Yes!

We went out from A&amp;E and I was going to drive both of us home. My mind just went blank during driving. Remember, if you are not well, don't drive. Don't be like me &gt;_&lt;”

People come on here when they’re vulnerable and they become encouraged to take their lives, not seek help, not given coping methods. Frankly, I’m more suicidal leaving this page than I was coming here after realizing the ridiculous amount of enabling that exists even in communities created for the opposite purpose.",depression

115649,"Being put in bad groups for school trips. So I just had this random pop-up, when 2 years ago, my year went to Alton Towers, and we were all assigned groups and ""We MUST stay in the groups at all times. This to make sure that we know where everybody is"" those exact words from the Head of Year. And the group I was in, there were 8 of us, were slightly ok. My best friend was in there, that was good, 1 was ok, the others I did not get along with.  But this was the worst part, my entire group were scared of big rollercoasters, and didn't want to go on them. Unlike them, I am the complete opposite, I love rollercoasters. *We did have fast-track btw.*  And I wanted to go on the rollercoasters, but they always refused and  went on the baby rides or just walked around the park. After about 2 hours of nagging, I finally made them go on Oblivion. They all agreed to go on it. And they were all scared to death. So then I said to them we should go on the smiler. They agreed, surprisingly, but all of them opted out. When I said we should sit on the front.  No I mean it, they all decided to quit.    So I went on the Smiler, and after the ride was finished I went to the exit, where I only found my best friend. 

I asked him where did everybody else go, he said, ""they got bored of waiting for me so they left."" I started to get my best friend on to the rides, and he although scared of them agreed he would go on them, only if I payed him £5 for every ride we went on. I agreed. For the next 4 or so hours, it was pretty normal, we did meet some of our other friends along the way. 

Come 3 o' clock, and we saw our Head of Year, he was angry at us. He then took us to the coach and we saw our other group, apparently the other group told our Head of Year, that we abandoned them.  I tried explaining to the teacher about what happened, that my best friend told me that they abandoned us, but he wasn't buying it because apparently ""7 against 2"". I was so close of punching all of them. We then us 2 had to sit out for the rest of the trip, because, I quote, ""We abandoned the group, which means that we had caused uncertainty to our location, information that we must know  to keep everyone safe. Therefor, we must now sit out, as you have broken the trust."" 

Me and my best friend just started to play games, because there was nothing to do for 3 hours.",non-depression

230692,"I have no idea what to doMy parents went on a trip for a week and 2 days ago they came back. I thought that it would be a good chance to kill myself when they're not home because if I failed I could just try again and no one would know about it. I didn't do it, but as soon as they returned from the trip I regretted it. Today one of my parents went on another trip and they'll be back on friday. This is my last chance. If I don't do it quickly I'll have to go through all these terrible things again. The only reason I'm afraid to do it is that if I fail and I'll be put in an in-patient unit for at least 6 months. I've talked about it with a doctor last time I was in that hospital and she said they can hold me there even for 6 months and I wouldn't be allowed to go out anywhere. This is the worst thing that could happen to me.
I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end. Every day I'm going through so much pain, I feel anxious and lonely all the time. I'm scared of my family, they're all passive-aggressive towards me, they try to manipulate and sabotage me. My mother screams at me all the time and blames me for being born autistic. I hate my father and we never talk, same with my younger sister. I'm scared of the future, I failed a year in school and I don't want to go there because I'm afraid others will bully me because of it. Even if they didn't I'm so ashamed of myself. I also have avpd, social anxiety and body dysmorphia, so going outsite and being around strangers is a horrifying experience for me.
I'm sure I will kill myself some day, I can't imagine living being transgender and autistic. I'm not asking you if I should do it or not. I know that I probably wouldn't be able to do it now. I just wanted to rant because I don't have anyone I could talk to about it, I'm so scared right now. I can't calm down, nothing gives me relief.

324405,"I have no reason to not kill myselfI've decided, philosophically and personally, that there is no reason to continue living. Here's why. 

All my life, I'd been successful. I was a straight A student in high school. I worked in a lab. I gave presentations to engineering companies. I did CAD for companies. I won awards. I had a 3.73 in college classes (for two years worth of classes, full time). 

Then I came to a top school in my field and I tanked. I failed calculus 2 my first semester. Now I'm failing (getting a D, maybe) in OChem 2. And I'm a chemistry major. 

I had a B all semester, too. That's the thing. And I got a B+ in OChem I. The thing about all of this is that I always started out strong, and was screwed by the final. 

Life isn't fair. 

Now my GPA is tanked, even if I retake OChem, because I still have Bs and Cs in my other classes, so I can't get into: nursing, business, med school, pharmacy school, engineering (you have to apply for a major here)... I'm barred from everything because of my first year mistakes that all happened in the span of four hours....

Not only that, but I might lose my scholarship if my GPA dips too low. I have severe anxiety. I don't have friends.

And there's nowhere my life can go at this point but down. I can never be an engineer. I certainly can't be a chemist, I can't fucking do OChem. Nobody is getting back with me with replies on working in a research lab, and the ochem lab I worked in this past semester I hated. I was supposed to have an internship this summer but with my gpa tanking I wont now. I've screwed my entire future. I might even have to retake my calc class again, and this time I can't even use forgiveness, so I'll have a D+ permanently on my record.... 

So I have no future. I don't want to be a fucking truck driver, or at tradesman who's back goes out at 50, or a waitress, or anything that's gratifying that I'll be poor doing anyway for the rest of my life. And I obviously can't be an academic. So I am going to kill myself. 

I have a bottle of benzodiazepines for migraines at home. As soon as I get home, I'm going to take the entire bottle when no one is there. I might leave a note. This is my note. But I'm finished. There's nowhere to turn that's worth while. And philosophically speaking, only a good life is worth living. I'm not going to hang by a thread in a shitty, underpaid manual labor job I hate because killing myself is somehow immortal. It's not worth it. So I won't. 

It's been real. ",depression
34191,"Sometimes it never gets better but try to avoid this before it’s too lateImagine yourself in a situation that you can’t decide which one is easier, keep living in a situation killing you slowly or committing suicide. 
First I’m gonna explain my life. I’m in a country that I’m not a citizen in and because of that I have no rights to stay or to get a job or to do anything. I ran from my own country because I got raped, humiliated, beaten, threatened. My family said I needed to get help from a psychiatrist/psychologist or whatever and I needed to be cured because of being gay. Nobody gave me a job, my family didn’t support me emotionally or financially, once police officers came to my home because neighbors complained about me being gay, I got beaten by some people four times, my cousin and my brother abused me dozens of times when I was kid, I got kicked off from some restaurants, hairdressers, markets many times, got raped three times, and so on. So that’s why I came to this other country and I asked for help, I went to many organizations, I talked with many people. Nobody can do anything right now and I try to survive by doing some things that I don’t wanna do. I slept with guys to eat and stay with them. And now I can’t do it because of some reasons. There is an organization and they told me they can help me in 2 months, but I only have one week to stay in the place that I’m staying and also I have no money. I don’t have anything atm except my phone and some clothes. I sold my other stuff to buy some medicines and food. I was saying “at least I’m alive and nobody is telling me I need to kill myself”. It didn’t last long. I just wanna die and escape from everything but I am not dying... I am thinking of killing myself but I’m afraid to do it and I don’t wanna suffer while I’m dying. I just wanna die instantly. But it’s not happening. People say I should think about the things what I got or killing myself is not a solution. I don’t want a solution, I just wanna relieve and get rid of all these things. And also I don’t have anything to lose. No family, no friends, no job, no money. Anything. I don’t even have hope. What’s gonna happen? Am I gonna find my place in this world and people who’re gonna be my family? Maybe, but I just have one week to find these. So I’m waiting for a miracle. Anyways, I’m writing this because I know there are a lot of people like me, even worse, but if you’re reading this and if your life is getting worse, please try to find help and hope. I wasn’t expecting to be in this situation, but here we are. Always try to have backup plans, never forget that everything is possible. Even I can’t believe that I’m living this. Just be happy and make plans, if they don’t happen, make another one. Live the moment but never forget yoir future. There are millions of good people, I couldn’t find one because I didn’t have enough time and couldn’t search enough. But you have time, please find them!

Note: this was copied and pasted from my journal i started writing today. English isn't my first language, so please understand some grammar mistakes. I live in an asian country with a education system that grades students relatively, and puts more pressure onto the kids. So it may be different from the us.


A certain illness seems to have consumed me. Depression, anxiety.. I can't exactly describe what is eating me up from the inside, but I feel as if a parasite is slowly eating me alive.

Today was a bad day. I feel a temporary sense of comfort whenever I say the phrase ""today was a bad day"" in my head. It feels like that all the terrible feelings I'm having is just caused by a bad day, and that tomorrow things will be better and everything will come back to place. But it isn't. All my days are bad days. Some are worse than the others.

I had a bad stomachache while I was going to school, and the bus was crowded and everyone was loud. I hate school. I hate every aspect of it. The teachers standing near the entrance checking the kids' uniforms, the posters and screens displaying pretentious videos about college admission, the chairs that are too rigid to sit, the florescent lights that are too bright and cold, the constantly shifting schedule, the teachers who don't seem to care about the students yet talk about college admission all the time and pressure kids to choose a major and a future job and plan out their whole career at 16. The kids that are too loud. Everyone is too loud. Everything is too loud.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be reincarnated into another person's body without my memory fully wiped. I feel like I'm living in another person's body. The only time I can feel truly myself is on the internet. I started a discord server a few days ago. Everyone was great, yet I felt miserable. I felt as if I was tricking them into thinking I was a smart and funny person. I haven't felt this in a while, and I cling onto that sense of self worth and belonging I can never get in real life. 

In real life, in school, in hagwon, it's different. I am still that star trek obsessed kid who thinks too much and tells weird jokes, but nobody knows be. Nobody knows who I am. Even my mom, my teachers, the kids in my school, nobody knows me. I can never talk about things I love in real life. I can't talk about html and building my own website with anyone, I can't talk about star trek or memes, I can't discuss philosophy or talk about how school sucks and how bad my day was. I feel like nobody gets me offline. I don't feel accepted. I feel like I'm the permanent new kid in my life.

I'm not seen as a smart kid anymore. When I was younger I was the gifted kid that always got stuff right, knew more stuff than the textbook, the kid who was always correcting the teacher, the kid who everyone asked things they didn't know. I was the kid whose teacher, when they called their parents, always told them how their kid was a bright and gifted kid. Everyone had high expectations for me, but now I'm disappointing everyone with my dropping grades and depression.

Tbh, I feel like I'm tricking everyone who views me as a smart person. I feel like an imposter who everyone mistook as the gifted kid when I was younger. I feel like I'm one of the the r/iamverysmart people who insecure with their intelligence. I feel like my whole childhood was a lie. 

Now people who don't know me well think I'm 'average"". Worse, they see me as a lazy, creepy kid who forgets everything, doesn't understand social cues and eats lunch alone. I feel as if there is an underlying, constant ""rage"" about myself and everyone in my life. The ""rage"" sometimes makes me want to kill myself, or worse, kill everyone in my school. I feel like a terrible person, a being who can't be even described as ""human"" when I find myself imagining blowing up my school with a bomb. That ""rage"" seems to come from my insecurity. I feel so insecure sometimes that it turns into a full blown panic attack like I would never feel happy again, like every inch of hope has been sucked out from me. 

I'm confused about my dreams and major too. One day I want to be a programmer/developer, one day I want to be a professor in philosophy/history/neuroscience/astronomy, one day I just want to earn a living and be on the internet and game all day, one day I want to be a writer, one day I just want to fucking kill myself. My teachers pressure kids to choose their future jobs/major quickly. They are always doing activities that involve kids to write down their future majors and careers. I can't be honest with anyone, sometimes myself too. I feel like that ruined my whole dreaming thing beginning in 2018. I stopped to think about my possibilities and stopped being honest with myself and always thought that I was too late and wasn't qualified.

Sometimes I have the sudden urge to get my shit together and do something with this life. Then after a day when I find myself forgetting an assignment or procrastinating, I feel as if I can't never get my shit together and fall back into that viscous cycle again. This has happened to much to me that it sucked away the hope and made me thing I was going to be doomed forever.

195407,"My experience with free therapy U.S.A. over age 45, for the middle aged readersI have posted here quite a bit, recently.

Some of my posts drew ire. 

I'm unable to endure some of the things people here have endured long term, thru their similar challenges.

Some people who became homeless can endure living in a tent, a shelter, taking free handouts &amp; working low wage survival jobs with no dental or healthcare &amp; living with strangers.

After 3 years, I can not. I'm done. Not everyone can endure living that way for long periods of time at mid age.

Some qualify for SSI/SSDI &amp; Medicaid. I do not. I have knowledge about the so called ""resources &amp; programs"" &amp; healthcare administration. It requires extensive medical documentation &amp; acknowledgement of education &amp; occupational skill level evaluations with Voc Rehab &amp; doctors.

What got us here isnt for the same reasons. But the system is designed to keep people enslaved, dependent, poor &amp; deprived of autonomy &amp; dignity.

Some people who were raised in poor homes can adapt. Not everyone can.

This is what draws ire from those who have endured. We're not all the same. 

I went to a non-profit mental health center in 2018 and a FREE county/State paid mental health clinic, to speak with a M.D. Psychiatrist.

This was due to job push outs at mid age combined with work place retaliation that wouldn't permit me time off as a NEW, mid age employee, to get corrective surgery.

Many of the Corporations where I WB whistleblew (one employer) &amp; that pushed me out of work, donate to United Way &amp; these non-profits. 

Some of these non-profits are shady. All businesses exist to make money. 💰💰

Unlike private pay, these places don't care if they help you or not. Most can't help. They serve as places to vent. 

""You get what you pay for."" 

The M.D. strongly suggested that I leave the area because I was in the South, in a lower demographic, from where I was raised.

The jobs &amp; the area were an obvious cultural mismatch.

I was encouraged to just pick up &amp; get employment and return to the expensive N.E.

I agreed. It does cost money to move. 

I needed a job, moving money, and a place to live. To rent, I needed employment. I never lived with random strangers selected from the internet. 

I always had my own place.
When I moved South, I had a job lined up and an apt with a commercial company that was well funded, safe &amp; maintained. My own lock, key &amp; lease.

I couldn't get work up North. I gave up my residence when I moved South. I needed a job to qualify for a place to live. I did an extensive search both in &amp; out of my career field.

My circumstances are complex. I am financially literate. Low wage jobs cant hire me. Temp agencies cant hire me. 

Its not that its beneath me. I would need someone to show me how I can survive and meet the basic necessities to live, while making an extremely low amount of money. 

I am #'s oriented &amp; adhere to a budget.
 
Many places of employment said I am overqualified. They didn't want to waste their time hiring a short term employee who would still be looking.

How do I know this?

I tried. The survival jobs were low wage, low skilled &amp; when they discovered I was still looking, the micromanagemt &amp; nitpicking to get me to quit began to surface. I wouldnt quit. They had to push me out. 

I've worked in prof'l Co roles to understand human resources, labor laws, management, healthcare costs, cultural fit &amp; employer liability concerns.

Co's do push out older people and they dont have to hire them either. In the recent jobs I had, the pay was inadequate &amp; did not meet my financial needs. I developed age related health issues &amp; I couldn't afford housing &amp; healthcare on the very low pay.

I have to earn a living wage. The Govt can't take care of me. 

The Govt programs provide subsistence level care that is inadequate. It doesnt meet everyone's needs. Most therapy isnt even on the same cognitive level for someone with advanced education, self awareness &amp; who had prior advanced therapy.

I was raised upper-middle class where I had the best education and medical &amp; dental care. I studied Masters level Psychology with my Masters academic degree program. I saw private pay out of pocket PhD &amp; M.D. therapists.

What kept me functioning was a healthy lifestyle combined with housing, healthcare, gym, yoga, dental &amp; vision care &amp; proper nutrition which costs money. 

Poverty living is hard on anyone. Men and women are not biologically equal. Younger people are not biologically equal to older people. 

I've aged out of Corporate jobs. Corporate jobs have been dumbed down due to automation. The wages have been stagnant, 401k &amp; pensions phased out with high turnover, out sourcing, &amp; lack of loyalty.

Its not that I dont want to work, I can't get work. From my pushouts &amp; lawsuits, the places need to be a cultural fit and pay a living wage.

My bills and obligations are not yours. Some people walk away from bills and they want others to do what they do.

Ignoring bills, lying on resumes, shacking up with strangers isnt something that works for me. I dont know how to dumb down &amp; function at a robotic sublevel. I tried. And the employers could see I was out of my element. Like what was I doing there?

What happened to get reduced to such a low level of existence?

I dont criticize others for their choices. What I needed to stay alive, thriving &amp; healthy is out of reach for me.

I don't really know where to begin but suicide is something I have been thinking about constantly. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to be anywhere or with anyone, and I don't even want to sleep anymore and that's the only thing that would numb my depression (because I wasn't awake to feel it).

I don't actually post online in general, but I am aware of trigger warnings and how seriously people take them, so, uh, obviously trigger warning about suicidal thoughts, and also self-harm, and pretty much every kind of abuse.


******
TL;DR: Long history of abuse, have never emotionally worked it out, doctor re-traumatized me very recently, this became an opportunity to connect with my therapist on a level where I could trust him enough to finally address old pain, until he realized he made a mistake, had to break my trust and do the one thing I was trying to avoid. Now I feel crushed and a sense of futility and am making stupid risky choices that could kill me, but not committing to a proper suicide plan. What's going on with me? Am I suicidal, or something else?


TL:
I don't know if I am actually suicidal, crying for help, looking for attention, overreacting, or what. I cannot commit to fully going through with it, so I feel like I still have hope. I somehow always find hope. But I am also hurting so deeply and feel like it will never get better, and am starting to obsess about the release of death. 


I have a way planned out to do it, should I ever fully commit to it. It's one of those things that I do not want to mess up. And the way I have 'planned' out is simple, requires little preparation or supplies, is easily accessible, and is practically foolproof. Basically, I have no excuse not to do it 'right,' at any time of my choosing, if I actually choose to kill myself at all. But I'm not there yet.


What I have been doing is going to sleep most nights on a handful of random prescription meds and some shots of tequila. It was mostly last week, and it was mostly combinations I felt very confident would cause me no long-term harm. Why do I mix them at all? I suppose it satisfies some burning need for self-destruction, especially lately since I have been hurting deeply.


The thing is, there were at least two nights last week, and especially one, where I flat out took a couple combinations of medications that are known to be fatal. And I didn't just take the doses I was prescribed...I took double, or triple, or quadruple on some pills. Then I added a bunch more pills, just 'cause - especially if they had obvious warnings about interactions with alcohol. Then of course I took a few shots of tequila. Then I took more pills. I recall thinking to myself, 'well, this may ACTUALLY kill me this time. Hell, by all rights it probably will.' I had survived taking the base combination of meds before, but only at single doses of each, or double-dose at most. And that was back when I was taking a LOT of meds, and had quite the tolerance. And I'd never mixed them with some of the things I did this time, which only enhanced the danger and chances of dying. And I totally knew what I was doing, and that - not only was there a CHANCE I could die, but by that point, a likelihood. And I went to bed feeling great. Light. Peaceful. I guess in my mind, I saw it as all of the advantages of suicide, and all of the advantages of an accident, which sounds terrible but is what it is. Some stubborn part of me doesn't want to admit defeat and choose to kill myself. Some part of me doesn't want my friends, few though they are, to think I wanted to do that to them. Some part of me still has hope, but I don't know why because I seriously have every ounce of hope crushed in my life somehow. The rest of me is exhausted, and really really hurting, and tired of trying my hardest and being defeated at every step. And those parts of me figured this was great - I would go to bed feeling calm and peaceful and guilt-free, because I 'legitimately' (in my mind) was not TRYING to kill myself, and I wasn't sure if I was going to die, so I would either never wake up and never know any better, and all of my problems would be solved without any of the guilt or misery of 'real' suicide, and my friends could wonder what made me so airheaded that night that I OD'd, instead of what made me so miserable that night that night that I killed myself. Or, I would wake up, still be alive, and not be any worse off than I was the night before, and maybe even wake up with a newfound sense of appreciation for life. Spoiler alert: I lived, sans new appreciation for life.


Now I am at a crossroads. I am out of all of the meds I used in the heavy-hitter nights, so I really don't think I have any meds I could take - even with alcohol - to accidentally kill me. But I'm still fantasizing about it, and obsessing about it. The more nights I go without some crazy OD, the more planning I do for my real life plans of suicide (updating my will, planning accommodations, etc). 


I suppose now is a good time to mention that I am taking antidepressants, and I regularly see a therapist. I really like my therapist, and I have been open with him so far about everything - even about the overdose of pills, even though I really didn't want to admit it. He's a good guy, and I have a lot of respect for him. There's just one problem right now...


It starts with my doctor, who I am no longer seeing. The TL;DR on that is he screwed up big time, said things tailor-fit to fuck me up (eg suggestions that I was 'asking' for sexual abuse as a toddler, shouldn't legally pursue the people who gang-raped me when I was 12 because they probably thought they were doing me a favor, and concerns that I was delusional and imagining present day porn into my past...and it just goes on). And of course, despite outright telling him I did not want to have sexual contact with him, he came onto me. I was in the middle of trying to finalize a very tricky diagnosis, so I'll admit that I let that continue for weeks because I was too afraid to lose progress. The good news is after four years of fighting, I finally got a diagnosis. The bad news is I'm dying. Win some, lose some?


I finally told my therapist about what was happening, under his word that it would remain in complete confidence and he would not have to report it. Telling him was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I can talk about my childhood trauma without batting an eye, but this was different. This made me feel vulnerable, and I took every ounce of trust and faith I had, and for the first time in my life, I allowed myself to put that in someone else's hands. It may seem like a minor thing to talk about, but for me, it was both symbolically and literally the hardest, most personal, scariest, and most meaningful thing I have ever told someone. It became the biggest weight I have ever felt lifted off of me. As we continued to talk about it, I found two things were happening:


1. I was feeling a lot more confident, and my sense of self-worth was going back up. I started considering reporting my doctor because what he did was wrong, and I did not want others to get hurt.


2. I was feeling much more connected to my therapist. Our confidence started opening emotional connections I've been lacking all my life, with others and within myself. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to make the connection I so desperately needed to finally confront the bigger stuff from my past, and also to finally have autonomy and feel empowered in standing up to an abusive situation (with my doctor) that had recurred all too many times in my life. It was a second chance to turn the fate of a recurring abusive scenario from my past around. so I was empowered, AND an opportunity to FINALLY, after decades of desperate soul-searching, tap into everything holding me back from confronting my demons and finally having closure in my life, especially before I die. That trust and that connection became the most precious, rare, and important thing I'd ever had in my life. I know that may sound pathetic to a lot of you, but understand that in my life, it is literally a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing.


For the first time since my flashback and depression hit, I felt true hope, energy, and empowerment for my future, and for my future work. I'd never been able to have the kind of trust needed to delve into the emotions attached to my childhood trauma, but here it seemed to finally be developing all on its own. It was literally the first time in my life I felt like I stood a chance of tackling those issues - which is more important to me than ever, since I want to reclaim them as part of my life before I go, and frankly my time is ticking.


I got the gut feeling that it was time to take action against my doctor. I marched into my therapist's office feeling strong. I knew it would suck, but I was ready to take it on, and it was my choice, and I knew he would be supportive. So, of course, before I said anything that day, he opened with an update that he had since realized he'd been wrong about the reporting requirements, that it was an honest oversight, that he'd tried everything he could to keep his end of the bargain, but that he had to break trust and was required to report the incident. To his credit, he was transparent about it, did everything he could to work around it, and then did everything he could to make sure it wouldn't happen to anyone else. To my credit, that doesn't make me hurt any less.


I know it seems silly. You might say, 'well you were going to report him anyway, so what does it matter?' and I'd even be inclined to agree. I think what is killing me is, the issue of trust - it was really, REALLY hard for me to trust my therapist, and relying on that trust and telling him was the hardest thing I've had to do, and the most trust I had to extend, since I was a small child. It was really, really meaningful to me, so even symbolically, breaking that trust is heartbreaking. Secondly, his mandatory reporting takes away my autonomy. If I changed my mind and decided not to report it, for whatever reason, it would no longer be my choice. And finally, in a few words it erased that feeling of emotional connection and trust I finally had, for the first time in my life, to work on these horribly traumatic issues I've had bottled up since I was old enough to have memories. To lose that...there are no words.


I don't know what to do. I'd like to think that we can work through this. I know he is genuinely remorseful, and that it was an honest mistake. But I also know he doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it is to me, or that it was opening up my trust to my bigger issues. In fact, he kept trying to convince me that my outburst of hurt and pain was really just a transference of the pain I was feeling from being traumatized by my doctor. That might have been one of the most hopeless feeling moments in my life.


I don't want to see another therapist. I don't think a different therapist will be any better. If anything, I'll just lose the trust and work I've established with my current therapist. And the trust that we built is not something that can just come from talking to someone. I stand just as much a chance of getting it back from him as I do getting it in the first place with someone else - IF I ever get it again. But I'm in my 30s, and that is the first time IN. MY. LIFE. that I felt that opening up, despite years of therapy, positive attitudes, success with life, and all of the right circumstances to have tapped it before now. It was a miracle I had the chance to get there once, and that happened because of a freak trauma that I HOPE to not have to repeat with anyone else again. 


So, here I am. In the middle of the night, on Reddit, typing my first post, which is embarrasingly long (and this is the short version), looking at my bottle of tequila, knowing I have to go to work tomorrow and put my brain full-force into intense thinky work things, wanting nothing more than to feel the pleasant floaty buzz of a drink and a few muscle relaxants, and maybe not wake up, ever again, and not have to try to explain to my therapist again that, I'm sorry, even though you weren't the bad guy here, what you did is really the thing that is hurting me, and I don't know that I will ever recover, which means I don't know that I will ever go on to accomplish my goals before I die. And the more I keep trying and failing like I have the rest of my life, the more it's just going to feel painful and empty in the end. And it's a sobering thought.


So then I soberly think about whether I'm ready to go through with my full-fledged suicide plan, or whether I'm willing to risk what is left of my hope (almost none) and my fighting spirit (all but burnt out) on some pipe dream of regaining this elusive sense of trust that only ever materialized from a traumatic anomaly, or whether I'm still stuck on tequila and prescription meds. And whether I'm suicidal at all.


Thanks for listening, and for making it this far.

I have no money and $1,800 in credit card debt.

I have hidden these horrible details of my life from my family for some time now; this has all happened within the course of a month. But I told my father about these things today and he, understandably, blew up. Then, he hung up on me. He doesn't want to talk to me. But it makes sense.

The shame is unbearable, the hopelessness ever-present. I don't see how I can come back from this. I've hurt so many people due to my choices. I'm a hinderance, a problem that can't be solved, and it seems now that the best thing to do is to take myself out of this world. I don't deserve to be in it and I have contributed nothing to it.

I am sick. It's not big news because I have been since I was abused when I was little. But 2 weeks ago, I got a lot more sick. And slowly but surely, I gave up. My friends and the people I have around me... well, I keep them in my heart since they didn't come to see me. 

I really tied to be a good person. Smiling, cheering people up, kind. Sweet enough not to be a burden but boring enough not to be remembered. 

Day after day after day, I've found it harder and harder to keep the pace. And now that I'm alone and don't have anyone to blame for it but myself, I'm reevaluating.

I'm leaving. Not my country, not this sweet town, not this decrepit hospital or the cold bed I'm in. I'm out. I'm done. I don't want to go on. I give up. 

I have spent a good part of my life learning to speak this beautiful language, I still make a lot of mistakes I'm sure (sorry about that). It makes me sad that I can only express myself like this, I know someone that'd say it's another way to push away the ones that want to help.

I would never ever be able to be independent, as I would have to rely on charity of others.

I'm living in a third world country where we have no adviced medical care whatsoever for the disabled, as I wouldn't even be treated as a human.

He said he was sorry. It was rough. I forgave him on the condition that he not lie anymore. He accepted. I asked him to get tested. Chlamydia. I got tested myself and was OK. Soon he told me he loved me. He said it several times over the course of a week. Then he said he took it back. He said it was a lie and he never felt that way. Crushed me. Even worse this time, but again we tried to move forward. Since then he's been a terror. Always mad at me. Always blaming me for everything. Yelling at me when I get sad about the current state of affairs. Drove home stumbling drunk and said I drove him to it. Packed his bags and threatened to leave. Triggered me. Got on my hands and knees and begged him not to go. He stayed. He promised he wouldn't do it again. He just did. Won't pick up the phone. I'm going to die. Please help me.",depression

181582,"First time I've thought like this, but seriously thinking it.Posted in r/depression, but stumbled upon this area. Seriously thinking about committing suicide because of how worthless I feel. Never in my 18 years, and hopefully 19 soon, have I ever thought this. At first I considered getting into alcohol or drugs (which I'm huge against), but then it finally grew into suicidal thoughts. 

Here's just some things that are really pushing my depression/thoughts:

First, the love of my life, or what I seriously thought was, finally told me that we can't be together, ever. 

Second, my family and I have been getting into it about financial issues and how working a volunteer position right now isn't helping. 

Third, I feel ashamed for having a friend that I seriously care about, break down on me because I told her I'm having these thoughts. It's gotten to the point where it seems as if she doesn't want to talk to me now.

And lastly, I keep having these visions of me eating a gun that is in my house, or staring at a belt to hang myself with. I'm scared that I'm having these thoughts, and it makes me sick to even know that I am, but I'm seriously considering it since I'm a worthless piece of shit to people. I feel that even the littlest thing will push me over the edge.

I've been here before under a different name, but never asked for help. So please read and ignore the bad grammar or punctuation mistakes you see. 

So where to begin... 

About two years ago my sister passed away from an aggressive form of cancer that was very rare for someone her age to get. She was strong, much stronger than me and had the mindset bound for success. And so here I am, thinking to myself ""why not me""? I was angry to the point where I thought I was going to go insane. Because there I was, someone who neglected to chaise their dream and constantly fall under the umbrella of mental drought -- still standing. Why? Two months and several weeks of stress later she was gone and so was the remaining sense of happiness and security. I was the one who was supposed to let everyone down while she achieved dreams and opened doors. 

During the past two years not much has changed. I'm jobless, currently have no money and now kicked out from my parents house. So where do I go from here? Two options. Either take my own life and give up or work on changing myself completely to hopefully one day reach everything I set my mind out to. 

I'll make the decision tomorrow. 

Final thought: I almost feel like I shouldn't post this, but screw it. The mods can take it down if it isn't appropriate.

Many hotline operators (not generalizing, I'm sure there are good ones) just keep repeating regurgitated platitudes, talk like robots, and are generally unhelpful. When I called one I legit thought I was talking to a bot, not even exaggerating. They also put me on hold for a rather long time, while I was about to kill myself. I ended up hanging up on them when I finally got connected because I realized they'd be no help to me.

They also have a tendency to call the police on people who aren't even actively suicidal. I just think that if you are having a crisis talking to someone else would be better, and it annoys me when people spam the hotline number over any talk of suicide thinking they are being helpful.",depression

my parents expect me to be the very best by getting all A's and doing well in the SAT, which is only normal for a parent to want. it's just so hard to be good for everyone else. i can't anymore. at this point, i'm not motivated to try and it's difficult to do simple tasks like waking up every morning. i was clean from self-harming for almost 4 months, but everything changed in the summer. now i can't go a day without self-harming or contemplating suicide.

  She cheated on me started on Thanksgiving  with a subordinate asshole from that job.  She now has TWO INCOMES AND TWO CARS and I have nothing!!

I know it’s nothing special because the switch to January 1 from December 31 is nothing more but a day change. Seriously though, it gives me an opportunity to make a new year better than what happened this year.

This year was by far my worst year. My senior year of high school ended abruptly so I had this super long break. Then later in august I started university which I wish I didn’t. I did absolutely horrible as I’m currently enduring Christmas break. It took me a long time to get used to things and exams were quite confusing.

Anyways, I’ve decided to drop out of university completely. I’ve already paid this first semester so I don’t plan on doing so for the next. Now I have absolutely no idea on what I wanted to do. I wish I learned earlier that I could go to community college instead or at least join the workforce. I feel like college isn’t something until the frontal cortex is fully developed. Or when we can make good decisions.

I don’t know what career would fit me. I’ve never had a job before. But I do enjoy reading, writing, and learning about healthcare and related sciences. I’m not a fan of math but it’s mainly because I have a hard time understanding it. Weird thing is that I used to enjoy reading and problem solving a lot but I feel like I’ve gotten lazier. Like I get distracted too easily. I have to have something to play with in my hands in order to do something or else I’ll get fidgety.

I think the big problem with me is I’m afraid of being touched. I don’t like anyone touching me anywhere, not even a simple high five or a handshake. Which this would be a problem in future job seeking. I’m not sure if it’s from some past trauma but I don’t like the feeling of another person’s skin on me. I don’t like people looking at me which I think they’re perverts if they do. This also makes me quite shy. Except when I’m online in an anonymous forum like this place. I sometimes get jealous or envious of others, and also defensive.

I know she's been going through depression and anxiety issues for a long time and that our relationship has helped her a lot during her dark times. We have a good  and healthy relationship overall and i've always been supportive and caring to her. 

This morning i got a message from her telling me that she attempted suicide and failed,  i feel completely broken and (even though i don't wanna accept it) mad, even though i'm in full support mode right now, i don't know what to do. I know she had suicidal thoughts before and i've always been there for her, i've never had to deal with this situation before.

English isn't my first language so i apologise beforehand

I'd appreciate any advice for this situation, thanks in advance

it does not have to be painless. just no way for me to back out during. fast.

pills, i have heard, do not really have a high success rate and there is too much time for me to possibly call for help. 

hanging is a possibility but i could only do it in a way that would allow me to save myself. i already tried this and was not successful (obviously).

321573,"TonightI’m 56yrs old. In the past, I have counseled others who have wanted to commit suicide and have done my part to get them to choose not to do it that day and redirect them to help and in some cases I’ve been able to witness, they lived on to enjoy better days. I know a lot of the arguments to use. They are valid. 

I’m stunned to discover that there are exceptions as to why one should not commit suicide and my case is one of them. If you’re suicidal, please don’t read this, it really doesn’t apply to you. 

I’ve experienced a series of circumstances (illness, divorce, job loss) that have led me to discover that some lives do have a value. Mine is about $4,700 (the total back log owing right now - the majority of which is rent due and I’m about to be evicted). I have no way of borrowing it, and to date after weeks, no guaranteed way of paying it back. I have applied for all kinds of jobs. I had a temp job that due to physical limitations I had to quit. I have applied for entry level jobs which I have not been able to get because I’m overqualified and in-between and career jobs which I haven’t gotten either. I have had professionals look at my resume and say “I don’t understand why you’re not at the director or VP level in a company” while at the same time not offering anything other than punctuation suggestions for changes. I’m not whining, I’m frustrated. 

I think of myself as someone who has undertaken many professional and personal challenges and have succeeded in substantial ways and have helped people along the way. Unfortunately this is contrary to the evidence all around me right now. I have started businesses in the past (I’m out of time and money to do so right now), I’ve worked up to 95 hours in a single week for employers (while on salary, and done so because I made a commitment to get a job done and it was for a worthy cause). I work hard.

I’m at a point where the usual arguments don’t apply. Things will get better. No, they’re about to get substantially worse. I’m about to be evicted and I have no place to move/store my personal stuff (I don’t have a lot either) and no where to live. I will only have my car and it is pad for and old. Family/friends are not an option. I’m about to lose my phone service and that will impact the type of job I can get and so far, I haven’t been able to get a job stocking shelves (at least I had the manager gush over how qualified I am). I know there are many people experiencing worse hardship than me but I just don’t see a way forward from losing my stuff and living in a car. 

I am about to lose the only thing of value I thought I had which was my reputation. I’m about to lose my apartment. About to lose my phone. About to lose the ability to present myself well enough to apply for jobs. 

I don’t really want to but I don’t really have a choice. I should do it tonight. I have a higher opinion of myself than I deserve. If I had a choice, I would have a modest job, pay modest bills and help people. I would have my own business or even be happy working at any number of jobs even below executive level. 

I have to do this because I have failed to basically live. Admitting it makes it a little more honest I guess. Sometimes it’s the logical thing to do.",depression

84393,"I just had one of the best nights of my life. Me and the bois went to a haunted trail for spooktober after being separated by COVID for 7 months. Okay, what we did first was go to house of pizza to eat and talk before the trail. It was your basic haunted trail for the most part, so here's the bloopers of the night. 
1. Two girls came up to the 10 year old of the group (F.Y.I we were all 14 and 15 besides him) And he refuses to go with them and calls them gay. 
2. When the 10 year old tried to climb a tree one of my friends says ""GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE"" in a way that made us stereotype him as an alcoholic dad.
3. When we're on the trail we are running from a guy with a chainsaw and one of my friends goes ""wait wheres Landon?!"" And we're all wondering where he is and then we hear screaming down the trail and he comes RUNNING with the chainsaw dude right behind him so we absolutely bolt from him.

137637,"Relative recently made an attemptDuring Thanksgiving I was told that one of my cousins (early twenties) had just been in the hospital after overdosing on a large amount of painkillers. But the people who pulled me aside to tell me about it all said that it was an drunken accident.  I did not believe them and so I messaged her about how I've struggled with depression and I'm here if they need anyone to talk to.  I also said that I saw a doctor and therapist in college and found an antidepressant that's helped me out and that if they wanted to find someone to talk to or had any questions that I could help.

They responded and didn't really confirm that it was a suicide attempt but didn't deny the implication either, and said that it meant a lot to them and that they had been considering talking to a doctor and maybe trying medication again, and that they would message me if they want help with anything.

Is there anything else I should say/do? We are not very close, my family usually only sees and talks to each other at holiday gatherings.  So I feel like if I start texting her then she will feel like I am trying to keep an eye on her and be annoyed. 

Also, I am confused about the situation because the rest of my relatives tried to tell me it was an accident, but I am not sure if they actually believe that. Her father didn't seem to act any different, and asked me to drive my cousin to her apartment afterward which I found odd because I would think that if he knew she was suicidal then he would have wanted to have more time to talk to her and make sure she was okay and got home alright. Or would have wanted her to stay with relatives or something so that she wasn't alone. I am unsure if I should talk to them and let them know that I think it was a suicide attempt, or if they already know and are trying to hide it?

If anyone has any advice please post. I don't really have any experience in this situation.  I read the talking tips and assessment guide on the right, but since we aren't close I'm unsure if trying to talk to her more would be good or not.",depression

So many different methods, brainstorming and thinking of which one would be most efficient and work best for me. I've decided that my best way to go would be overdosing on Benadryl, possibly getting drunk beforehand, fastening a bag on my head and hoping that I'm unconscious when I run out of air. I dream of it, imagine it, it's like it haunts me while still being some kind of twisted fantasy. 
I know why I'm so fucked up. I've been in therapy for almost 3 years, which has made a miniature dent in the issues I have. Here's a bit of backstory.
First off, my dad abandoned my mother and I before I was born. Things weren't bad yet but this will play an important part later in life. 
My mom met my now ex-stepdad when I was 3 or 4. He was really nice at first, treating me like his own daughter. After my brother was born and I grew older, he changed drastically. I don't want to go into too much detail but let's just say years 7-15 were a mix of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. My father died when I was 10 and he did his best to beat the tears out of me.
When I was 15, I got the courage and support to  report him. Went to trial 2 years later, he was slapped with 74 years in prison. If you have the right keywords, there are plenty of articles that can detail what went on.

I still haven't recovered from all that. They say actually holding them accountable and standing up to your abuser strengthens you and helps you heal. For me, I just feel weaker and weaker. I tried killing myself over a fucking guy like four months ago. 
I'm trying my best to get better but I'm so fucking done. I feel my mental health crumbling more and more every single day. I've been diagnosed with a chronic condition and live every day in pain. I'm so ready to give up, I have the materials, I have notes written to those I love. I fear that I'm just annoying if I reach out too often, so I'm near giving up on that too.

I've just put myself in a muddle by putting up each and everything I could find on my plate.   
I have my final tests in about 2 weeks but our teachers still have so much to complete and I have to study them on my own  
I have about 1 more year for deciding my college stuff and starts with my SATs and writing them while struggling to complete school hw and tests.   
I have to struggle with a resurgence of migraines (low stage) and cannot get much help from medicines or painkillers cuz my body's had too many of them  
I'm just sick of sitting in front of my classes and yet not being able to learn much from them even though I should  
I'm sick of life and not having more than 2 legit people I can talk to, but they too are now kinda busy so am left to deal with myself and my lonely self in the morning.   
I'm completely done with talking to multiple people or friend groups or discord servers because all I've tried it just ain't for me, cuz I always end up somehow putting myself in the wrong light and leaving in anger of not doing much with life.   
So I'm stuck all day in a class which I'm not interested in, while I can't do what I want nor have some person I could share all this arseholery with.   
Idk what to do or where to start with, but ig I have a ton of stuff I could do but am not allowed to. I have to complete hw but I've done it. I've done SAT prep and need to do more but can't cuz I have JEE on the line. 

Idk if it's a small hint at extreme immaturity, but I don't wanna grow up. I don't wanna deal with so much and get nothing much in the end. I don't wanna go live a life where I'm stuck with all this bullshit from my past life. I wanna sit and grind away at more ways stuff like non-JEE prep school and Valorant or stupid mobile games. 

Why do I say this? Cuz I'm done with so much of my life tbh. I know I have a long time ahead of me but I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just see a turn to something even darker. Idk what to do with this life of mine cuz I believe I have the potential to do what I want but don't want the toll of doing it and it being meaningless in the end. 

Any help to get my life in better shape and more independent than depending on 2 discord friends to lift the shit up for me?

This kept on so long I started doubt I will ever break out of it or have decent life. And with decent I don't mean money , partner or anything material. A decent life for me would be one I can enjoy or at least stop hurting myself and wishing to die.

I HATE MYSELF so much , I started to get teary just continuing with this post . but at least I know I have some emotions

At least this is what I thought. I found someone. They made me feel complete, heard, and cared about. Now, tonight, they have told me that they do not and will never love me. 

I have been in this country for six months, and I must continue to work. 

I have elected to start a starvation regimen. 

As the world slowly eats itself away, so too will I and my relentless recurring act of loving people who cannot love me. 

The beauty of this is that I can always take action. I can change my path. I am in control. Right now, though, I plan for the ultimate self control and determination to give myself some dignity in these last moments.

Unfortunately I just lost my 11th job over this, and it's put me in more debt. (Ober £20000 now). 

My illness is not recognised as a disability in the UK, so I dont qualify for benefits for it. Just job seeker's, but I only get jobs if I lie about my sickness. Then I'm usually fired after repeated absence. My employment record is an absolute joke. Nobody would hire me.

So, because I don't really have much quality of life anymore and I'm sick every day and I'm struggling to live of unemployment benefits I was wondering if it would be possible to file for assisted dying? 

I have heard it is legal in the Netherlands.. My doctors just recommend more antidepressants. Ive had this for 5 years now, I have lost 11 jobs, I'm in 20k of debt over it, I lost my house, my car and most of my possessions. So sadly it won't get better because I can't be cured.

So my real question is, is this my last option? Or is there something I have missed.

Am I so awful that I deserve these things? I just had a friend cross the line with me, and it's the most stupid fucking thing for her to ever do.

I can't talk to her right now. For my own mental safety I cannot.

I hurt. Not just from her, but from my lover. I told them what happened, I told them I cannot talk to her for the time being because I hurt. They assumed I was in the wrong for what she did. 

What is the point of being in a relationship when the other doesn't have your back? Why did you want me to justify myself? Why did you automatically assume that SHE was having issues and that is why SHE screamed at me like that? Why didn't you want to hear the full story and understand me?

People who do the things she did, there is no excuse. There is no excuse for that behaviour. She wasn't even going through a ""tough time"" like you suggested, and that still wouldn't excuse her behaviour. You don't do those things to the people you care about.

Last week I felt rationally that depression was impacting my thoughts, because I realised they were more negative that they should be. This week I'm past that, and I think I'm just going to have to figure out how to go and that'll be it. 

Part of me thinks this is crazy talk. Part of me thinks it's the only way forward, because I can't be fixed and I don't want to live the rest of my life as I do now.

282616,"All my fault but do i really deserve this punishment?Sooo i never thought of sucide but some deep shit just went down and it can't be un done,fucking hell i can't even type right now without feeling guilty.I don't think i'll resort to sucide now but it really seems like the only way out of this shit hole i'm in.Soo..in my house are 4 people including me.My father,mother,older brother and then me.I'm the one who shouldn't be there,i don't fit in well,the only person i can talk to is my mom but she works too much and i can't talk to her in private all that much,I feel like she's the only one who understands me but even she was the one today who went like ""it was your fault"" so i believe her,my dad wants everything his way,i try to do what he says but i end up failing.If he sees me playing video games or doing something on the computer that isn't productive he commands me to get the fuck off.My brother is my older brother and he somehow has the right to hit me because he's older,that's the thing in our family.Good thing my dad hasn't hit my mom yet because he's older,i'd rip the guy's head off.I'm not weak,i did get in physical fights with my brother and did scare off my dad because he didn't wanna get hit when we got in little fights,My mom told me to bite my tounge and do the bullshit they call ""turn the other cheek"" and not get in fights with them because after all they're older.The way it always starts off is by disagreement on little things and my dick of a brother has an ego problem of he's always right and if you argue/talk shit you get hit,and that is acceptable to my dad,speaking of my dad,he comes from a family of 7 siblings,5 brothers 2,sisters,he never got along with any of them really.I don't say stuff like ""you could have done better"" because i know what he's gone through and if i do he would commit sucide,or something close to that.This family is broken and all because of me,i said earlier my brother has an ego problem but now i believe them when they say i have an ego problem,i gotta always throw my 2 cents in(or whatever they say) I'm in an east Asian family where moving out isn't the option to make your family proud but right now i don't even give a shit about them,only one i care about is my mom she's the one i would actually support and send money to if i get a job.Jesus christ,what the fuck am i writing,must be cringe worthy,Ok so that was the background of my family and now we can get to what happended today:We got chromecast on our TV,i had the phone in my hand to watch whatever the fuck i want on the TV,phone was on 4% and connected to the charger near the corner of the couch,my brother asks me to give him the phone about 3 or 4 times and then kicks me(he was laying down so you can imagine what that would look like) and then i respond(i was just out of the zone for a few seconds),so since i didn't respond to him saying my name and asking me for the remote the first time,i was at fault according to my family(even my mom) i admit i was wrong there,i shouldn't have ignored him saying my name 3 or 4 times and i should've responded but i didn't,we go inside our rooms,don't talk.Dad comes home,everythings peaceful,until he calls my brother from his room and he doesn't come,he doesn't come because he's pissed at the incidence where i was at fault.My dad just fucking starts yelling at him and me and tells me to not talk to him and him to no talk to me,because according to him that works and solves all the fights,i argue with him to preserve my integrity and he just says ""i don't fucking want you""(not directly in english but thats the translation of what he said) ""i just wanna get rid of you"",""i told you a million times and it just doesn't work"" so that hit me real hard,i have a feeling to quit it all and i don't think that will ever go away,nor am i talking to him again to be honest.There is that side of me which just wants me to exclude myself from those 3 because i start fights in this house,and there is the other side of me which cares about my mom and what she would think of looking at my dead corpse,My dad once told her to not talk to me and then left,i still talked to her because i'm not really scared of him when he's gone and she said that she loves me more than him and is willing to leave him for me anyday,Of course they didn't split up or divorce it was just her way of telling me how much she loves me.Summary:I live in a family where hitting of someone younger is allowed if he makes the older person angry(which is possible since the elders say some crazy/stupid shit),my mom is the only one i love in this family,i'm the odd one out,i start shit,i really don't belong with them.What can be the logical thing to do? My dad did say ""i don't want you i tried everything with you"" like do i really deserve that? I said im not weak earlier but i really am,i can't even think of doing it but i just wanna quit somehow.Just anyway.",depression

But none are as brutal nor as demoralizing as **Ass Fire 🔥 **. Usually triggered when you take a runny shit after eating chipotle, fried food, or other dangerous gambles. 

Once it begins there’s no stopping, you have horrible cramp if you don’t take the shit, but once you do, you’ve signed yourself up for a hellish burning sensation in the ass, sometimes lasting over an hour. A prolonged period of clenching, sweating, praying, and even suicidal ideation, and serious questioning of why you ever eat out at all

5638,"I'm Lost.I don't know where to begin. Everyday is a struggle. I've repeatedly been making attempts on my life since about December. I tried hanging in the beginning, with little success because it seemed too painful. 6 or 7 times of that made me realize that it wouldn't work. I broke in October, and took 1500 mg of antidepressants, more than 60 times what my dose was, in hopes that I would die. After puking and having severe pain for hours on end and texting everyone I loved, I told my mom, because I thought about my families suffering. I was taken to the hospital, then I was put in a psych ward. My experience there wasn't great, as I saw kids even younger than me, around 12 years old, who had attempted to slit their wrists, and the help they tried to provide, in the form of group therapy, did nothing for me. Not even 2 weeks later, in the early months of November, I accidentally slipped in conversation, and my mom realized I had plans to try to kill myself again. She forced me to go into the hospital, and despite my protest, another psych ward. At this Psych ward, my experience was terrible. We were neglected sufficient water, they stopped doing check ins, and they screamed in a room full of kids with PTSD. They were constantly triggering kids with these severe issues, and the constant yelling has caused me to occasionally shake if I hear loud noises. The workers also stopped doing their check ins at some point, so I would see kids start slitting their wrists with things they stole from the workers, so I had to take it into my own hands to stop them. When I was there, I met people who had been raped, their children beaten to death by their parents, forced to take alchohol, but one stuck out. One girl, who was my same age, 16, had been forced to drink alchohol when she was 2, was beaten by her father, forced into sex slavery, tazed 27 times in a basement as punishment and locked in a basement for 48 hours, intentionally starved, saw her friend get shot at point blank and the blood splattered on her, her brother was shot over $50 of meth, and she resorted to any drug you could think of. She had been stuck in Psych wards, residencies, and foster homes, and none of them could sufficiently do anything. She got in this time for jumping in front of a speeding car, and narrowly avoiding death. I thought she was pretty, but I recognized we were in a psych ward, so I didn't take any action, yet. In our groups she mentioned that she liked weightlifting and playing violin, which were 2 of my favorite things. We started to discuss more and more and found that we had a lot of common things we liked. I completely fell for her at that point, and I told her, and she said she felt the same. From that point on, we held hands and hugged when the workers weren't looking, we fell asleep in the hallway looking at each other from the distance between us, and constantly telling each other we love each other. We made plans for all the things we wanted to do, places we wanted to go, and I told her I wanted to give her the life she never had. At some point, the staff realized, and tried to separate us, but before I left, those staff members were gone, and we could see each other yet again. I had seen her arms covered in scars from cutting, and that is the point where I had to start sneaking into her room to take stuff so she couldn't cut herself because the workers didn't do anything about it. On the final day, we were hugging at any possible second we could and repeatedly saying I love you, promising that we will begin to date once she is out of the next stage of treatment. I hugged her before I left, she promised me she'd be alive for me, and I had to leave. I had snuck her snapchat and Instagram accounts so I have her contact, but she is in residential. I looked into it and talked to my psychiatrist, and he said residential can be anywhere from 4 months to 2 years. She is the only reason I haven't ended it all. I feel horrible all the time. I've tried medicine, I've tried new sports and hobbies, I always feel like shit. I see so much suffering in the world, nothing brings me joy anymore, and the medicine puts me in constant pain. I'm scared I'm gonna end up trying to kill myself again, but I'm scared to go into another psych ward or residential. I leave her 2 paragraphs everyday on snap for when she gets back about how much I love her, and that's about the only coping I can do anymore. I promised her I'd give her it all, because she is my only motivation anymore, and the last thing I'm holding onto, but I may not get to see her for a year or more. I don't know what to do. Everyday is pain. I've tried and tried for a full year now, trying to stay alive for whatever I have to hold onto. She is the only hope I have left in this world and I can't even talk to her right now. I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.",depression

120094,"How to help a friend who doesn't really want help?Hello, this is my first post here (or ever on reddit) so hopefully I am doing this right.

I've been trying to be there for my friend while he is dealing with a major depression, which has lasted about a year now (although I suspect he's been depressed on and off before this one.) He's been hospitalized before, and he has a psychiatrist he see's about once a month. His parents don't really understand the severity of his situation, even after his hospitalization, and have told me to just encourage him to be positive, and smile more. He has a few friends, but he's been pushing a lot of them away/isolating himself more and more.

The issue is he is not getting better, but rather much worse. He attempted suicide about a week ago and was brought to the hospital, but he wouldn't disclose to the doctors or his parents what the reasons were for why he was so sick (they must have just assumed it was an accidental alcohol poisoning...). I've been trying to talk to him, and I have been nearly everyday for the past 6 months. He doesn't want help. He doesn't think things will ever be better, and he says he doesn't understand why people won't allow him to rest in peace. I know that is a symptom of his depression, but I really don't know how to get through to him. He is also an incredibly stubborn and intelligent person, so he will argue and fight me when I try to encourage him to hang on, and when I give him reasons for why he should. He is on medication but it doesn't seem to be working well. He told me it just makes him feel an empty happiness and that it means nothing, and things are still bad.

I just don't know what to do. I want him to talk to his therapist about his most recent attempt, but he doesn't want to do that. I don't know if I should try and get him to the hospital again, because last time that wasn't too effective... I'm just at a loss of what to do. Any advice would be sincerely appreciated.

100920,"Cheated OnHi there, a little background information on me: My name is Alex, I turned 24 last month and I broke things off with my ex (23) last weekend. We've dated for two years and have been on and off for the longest time. She has borderline personality disorder and I have my own issues with abandonment growing up. When we first met, we hooked up rather quickly and it was a huge red flag for both my mother and I, but being as I had never had a girlfriend before, I ignored them and pursued a relationship with her. Throughout the course of our relationship, she kept a lot of male attention and claimed they were only friends when in reality she was either cheating or making money as an escort online. She'd cheat, I'd find out, we'd break up, we'd miss each other, we'd get back together, and on and on... It eventually started to take a toll on me and I attempted to take my life because I felt like I wasn't worth anything anymore. All the abandonment issues I had been running from in my childhood started to surface and I couldn't handle the overwhelming feeling that I wasn't good enough for anyone to love. Long story short I ended up 5150'd and on release I found my phone flooded with sobbing messages of regret from my ex. It's so hard hearing the voice of someone you love saying how much they miss you and love you and regret everything they've done and apologize like they've never done before, but looking back I know I fell in love with someone who doesn't exist all the time. We were together for a few months before she started doing the same thing again and I ended things off. I spent a while alone trying to date around and ended up meeting someone else who on paper seemed like the ideal girlfriend: no mental problems, had a job, had a car, had her own place--everything my girlfriend lacked. The only problem was that I wasn't physically attracted to her. I broke things off with her after two months because I realized it wasn't fair to waste her time if I wasn't falling in love like I had with my ex. A month later, my mother and stepdad were planning a thanksgiving dinner at the local country clubhouse where my ex worked (I had assumed due to her borderline personality disorder and work history that she wouldn't have held down this job) and offered to buy me a seat so I agreed. She ended up still working there and the entire time she was really pleasant and nice to my parents while I tried being an asshole and just ignored her attempts to strike a conversation. At the end of the dinner when we were about to leave, she asked my parents for a hug and they agreed. The whole time, they were falling for her shit and I really hated it so I just walked off to the car alone. When I got home I messaged her back telling her to eff off should we ever run into her again and that I didn't appreciate the little show she put on. She defended her self and said that during our break up (it had been 8 months or so since we last talked) that she had done some growing up, she had kept her job, and had really been ashamed of everything. We talked for a long time and we eventually got back together. We were together since Nov and it ended last weekend when I caught her talking to other guys who openly flirted with her despite her mentioning me. (I don't know to what extent this flirting went to because she deleted the history prior to the day we broke up, but the day we did, they had flirted and he seemed to have been giving good morning texts so...) Either way, right now I feel a bit hopeless. I feel worthless and lost right now. I don't know where I'm going or what my purpose is, but I can't help but feel like I'm at fault. Was the sex bad? Was I not giving enough attention? Am I ugly? Poor? Short? What's so wrong with me to deserve this? I don't know what to do, I just want to run away from this pit of despair in my gut. I just want to go home and have a beer and cry all this crap out because I have too much to live for.

I have no family and no friends whom I do not hurt.  I'm a selfish bitch and I honestly feel that I would be doing a service to the world if I expunge myself from it.  To allow myself, as destructive as I am, to continue to live would be selfish.

Today was my breaking point.  The two people I respect and look up to the most in the entire world I have hurt and disappointed, and they are upset with me and I cannot take it anymore.  They are my research advisors, (they are married), and I loved them as dearly as a daughter would love her parents (I always wanted parents, but I've been alone my whole life, save for a meth-addicted father who sold my body to his friends for drug money when I was 13-14 and is now in prison).  

Recently, I was taken advantage of by an old high school friend and I've been struggling emotionally since that night. Two days ago, I told one of them that I was really anxious and a bit vulnerable, but yesterday he completely snapped at me (for what I perceive as no real reason - it was a miscommunication).  I left the lab in tears, but I returned today because I do have work to do.  However, when I arrived my other advisor took me aside and told me that I'm too emotional and that I have been causing stress to her husband, whom I idolize.

And two days ago, I made on of my friends cry.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I can't take it anymore.  I can't take the fact that I'm so self-absorbed I hurt everyone, EVERY ONE I care about.  I can't stand myself.

I am truly convinced at this point that getting over my fear of death would be the right thing to do.  ",depression

105532,"DepressedLately I've been depressed, more depressed than I was already. Depression cause by stress, stress caused by family. Back when I was a Christian/Agnostic I would have thoughts of suicide. I would think that maybe if I commuted suicide and saw God in heaven he would see that I'm a good guy and turn the other cheek. When I turned into an atheist I got an immediate high. This high was made possible with the realization that I am my own maker and that I ultimately have control over my destiny. The depression went away but not for long.
My family, being the Protestants that they are, scheduled a mandatory bible study every night and made me attend every hutch activity when they found out the news. I, having no friends outside the faith, have no one to TRULY talk to about this matter in real life. I talked to some but it's always the same shit, turn to their god for the answer.
Now I'm more depressed than ever: no friends to help cope with, family is at its worse, and - recently turning nineteen, having no job, and relying completely on my parents financially - no where to escape.

The reason I live today is because reality is all I know to be certain and I don't want to end it early, but if its constantly filled with depression and no sign of getting out of it any time soon, I might do just that. What can I do?",depression
80046,"Big Sad Hello, I don’t really post here on reddit but I don’t have anyone to talk to since all my friends are busy and I shouldn’t even bother them with bullsheights in the first place.

I’ve been avoiding one thing that I loved because it has caused emotional shenanigans in me and that is reading Manga/Manhwa or idk what you call those. Reading stories used to be fun and exciting for me but as the years went on, it’s starting to mess with my emotional state. I mostly read BL because I am a smol closeted boi and I’ve always wondered what it’s like to have a relationship as two guys. Some ends with happy endings but most would end in a very tragic way and whenever I read a new story, I cannot seem to go past the conflict part of the story and would just stopped reading altogether.

It feels like a dumb bitch move to avoid it but the motto “face your fears/problems” only made things worse as I’ve been suffering with depression since I stepped foot on this world. The last Anime I’ve seen was “Given” and I didn’t know this one has a sad story and I thought watching BL Anime would give my little gay heart a bit of happiness but oh boy did I thought wrong. At that point, I legit cried after years of not being able to do so.

I don’t even know what this post is all about tbh. I just want to express a portion of my feelings since it’s starting to get hard bottling them up.

Seeing all posts about getting a partner or even just talking about yall crushes,, they make me in awe, like you guys are really out here feeling all that “butterflies in your stomach”. But for some reason, it also makes me sad, in a way that I don’t think I am capable of those things. Considering how I cannot look at conflicts in stories, how much more if it were in real life.

And I know that maybe “i am not ready” but this has been going on for years and the thought that it could still go on makes me even more sad. It’s like a cycle or something, i dunno im dumb as hell. I can tell my friends are tired of hearing/seeing me talk about this thing. Honestly idek what the hell I am talking rn if you made it this far, sorry for wasting your time.

There are still 2 months for my final exam which is MHCET and I still have some hopes left with it. But at the same time my depression is not letting me study at all and I am worried about it. Anyone who would just help me give enough of some motivation to start my studies will be of great help. To be honest I feel useless and I never want my parents to do anything good for me because I wasted their money.

I know there are still chances at life and if I start studying I will surely get selected but my depression and sadness isn't letting me study at all.

I am just done. it ends todayI am 38, I am morbidly obese and struggle with it my entire life.  today for example I had one piece of pork chop and a half a cup of rice and a half a cup of peas for breakfast it was all I had to eat in the house. it was my left over dinner from last night. my cousin can literally eat an entire large 8 slice pizza in one sitting then 5 hours later go back in the kitchen eat 4 hot dogs on bread with mayo and cheese and still not gain weight, sleeps 12 hours a day plays video games the other 12. I on the other hand basically starves myself and eats very little and works out an hour in the morning, an hour in the evening and counts my cals in and cals out. and drinks water. his cal intake is way over 3000 and hes 35 yrs old and only a 180 lbs and never gains. when we have hamburgers for dinner once per month he eats 6 of them with everything on it and the buns. me, I eat just the patty and only two. I basically torture myself with not being able to eat good food because it seems everything I eat just goes right to my stomach, thighs, legs, butt, arms, face. 

I have been around 400 lbs my entire life and struggled with it my entire life since I was a kid and have always been active. played sports, etc was homeless for many years still couldn't lose weight. past eight years I decided to put myself out there in the dating scene figured why not. fuck it. I got over all my insecurities, learned to accept my body and weight, learned to love who I was and accept myself for me. was not an easy road considering my entire family told me I was a horrible person, I was ugly, I was disgusting, I was trashy etc. 

Well in the dating scene all I got was rejected, told the same things my own family told me, I was ugly, trashy, disgusting, worthless, useless, had nothing to offer, no woman would want me, I am nothing but filth, I should be ashamed of myself for being so fat, I am worse than a drug addict for being so fat, How could I get so fat. Mocked at, laughed at, made fun of even told to end my own life. 

Past eight years I have had women tell me I sound like a great guy, a decent guy, a wonderful guy, I would make a great boyfriend, a wonderful husband, a wonderful dad, any woman would be lucky to have a man like me, but as soon as they see a pic of me and see my weight their entire tone changes and I am a horrible person and I don't deserve anything and I am disgusting and filthy etc etc etc. 

I can't take living in this world anymore being unloved, unwanted, not needed, undesired, uncared for. I can't do it anymore. I been alone my entire life from the age of 5, I literally can't do it anymore. just going out in public seeing couples together, it kills me inside and my heart drops to my feet because its all I want is someone to get close to, to share my life with to build a life with. When I hear women talk about how their recent ex left them or cheated on them or dumped them or used to beat them, it breaks my heart because here these guys had a good woman, and a child, didn't give a crap and took it for granted and in the mean time here I am can't even get one date and all I get is rejection after rejection. I just can't do it anymore. I am done. goodbye.",depression

164168,"For those contemplating suicide, and want help. I’m here.I’ve realized now, that it’s important to embrace who you are and what you deal with. For too long i have tried to hide who i really am, and what i really feel, afraid of others looking at me as weak. For years now, i have dealt with serious thoughts of suicide, from a simple lack of motivation to live. Just last week i held a loaded gun to my head, praying for god to give me the strength to shoot. I am saying this to emphasize the point that, mental health is not a joke. It is not easy for someone like me to get up everyday with no real motivation to live. For a long time, i thought i felt this way because of breakups, or financial struggles, but i know now that is not the case. I felt the way i did, because i was afraid to be honest and open. I would sit at home and think about death, then go out in public and pretend nothing was wrong. All the while, making the situation worse. So now i am making an attempt to be open, hoping that this will relieve me of these thoughts, and allow me to be happy again.
Recently my girl friend, my life, my girl... all of a sudden broke up with me. I wasn’t expecting it at all, so it broke me completely. I am the type of person who has never seen value in living for myself, so the thought of losing her, was the same as losing my life. I wasn’t perfect in the relationship, i definitely made serious mistakes. but I loved her. and I thought that together we would conquer the world. This is all i wanted. but when she broke up with me, i felt empty. I felt the same way i did before i met her. I lost my motivation to live. I lost my will to fight, i wanted to die. I tried for weeks and weeks to just make her notice me again, make her love me again, and nothing worked. Nothing i did made her want to be with me again. So i ended up, in my bathroom, Beretta 92fs cocked and loaded, pointed to my head, ready to die. With my finger on the trigger i smiled as i finally felt i would be happy. Then something stopped me. Unable to shoot, i cried until my sister came and took the gun away. The next day, i got up and went to work, pretending to be okay, when a random guy, i had never met before walked up behind me. This guy patted me on the back and said “life is worth living.” 

I’m sorry if my thoughts seemed jumbled but I am still trying to make sense of everything. How does a random guy, come up to me and make such a powerful statement? What made him choose me, out of the 30+ people in the room?

I don’t know, but that one statement saved my life. That one statement is inspiring this message, and inspiring me to live. I haven’t been able to find what i am living for, but i know i have a purpose. So if you happen to be struggling like i am, please know that things will get better. Winter can’t last forever, and Spring is coming. and If you fall, land on your back, because if you can see up, you can get up. Remember that.

330185,"Everything feels so dark now (sexuality and gender issue)I am 26, and over the last couple months, it seems I have lost what was once a sky high, almost obsessive level (for example, I have a folder of over 1,000 photos of women, ranging from women in porn, on TV, and ones I know in real life, which I would often pleasure myself with) of attraction to women, and in its place, gained a small degree of attraction to males (At least I think so, I notice them a little more I think, but none of them have caused me to feel aroused in the same way women did), as well as gender confusion. Feeling like I lost that attraction has taken a toll on me, as it's one of the things I enjoyed most. I would always fixate on women in some form or another, usually sexual thoughts about them, romantic ones, and the occasional fantasy of being one, which I will go to again later.

This began after a chat in a fetish chat room, involving a gender change fetish. I had for the last few years, had sexual fantasies about being various attractive women. In regards to that chat, one user told me my attraction to women is envy, and that's why I am so obsessed with them, basically saying I want to be one myself. Ever since then, it seems my attraction to women has disappeared, and a mild attraction, or so I think, to males has popped up. Prior to this, I had actually been getting more confident with women, for the first time in my life. Also, I feel intensely depressed, and a strange sense of depersonalization, like my identity is gone. On the topic of gender, for the last few years, I had also taken a big interest in trans issues, trans timelines, the lives of women who transitioned, and was doing things like looking the effects of HRT, sometimes obsessively. I also a few times engaged in a chat on the random chat site, Omegle, stating I was female, but in a completely non-sexualized conversation. Some of this makes me wonder if what I thought was a fetish might be something more, that and the idea of living as a woman doesn't bother me. Also, the range of women I imagined myself as expanded over time, starting as the hottest ones, then going to more average ones. As for the sexuality aspect, in those fantasies, I would imagine myself in straight scenarios, lesbian, and sometimes, even non-sexual ones, the last of those being kind of telling. I sometimes wonder if this depression I feel isn't really a form of gender dysphoria. I didn't seem to have any noticeable signs as a child of being trans, but being told that I envy women and want to be one seems to have triggered something in me, also, me not feeling anything wrong with the idea of living as a woman is also suggestive. Currently, I don't know if this is a gender or sexuality issue at its core, but regardless, it has me feeling my lowest, and at times, I get thoughts of just ending it all, or wishing I wouldn't wake up. This is my lowest point ever, by far.",depression

I always said we aren't dating because she needs time to recover from her ex. Since she has a bunch of shit going on, shes almost over her ex. Then again there is the shit going on. Her grades are slipping, her dad is emotionally (and I could argue physically) abusive. She has anorexia, she considers 750 calories a day overeating. As a result, she has severe malnutrition and irregular periods that put her in agony every day. Her dad refuses to see the problem. She doesn't eat. 

Pros if I decide to date her: I'll be a helluva lot happier if I'm less lonely, someone to cuddle with, someone to rant to, someone to listen to my random bullshit. 
Cons if I decide to date her: were not even sure if she is attracted to guys, her body language suggested that she is afraid of me, shes not emotionally prepared for a romantic relationship, I'm not ready for a romantic relationship in general. 
Parental opinions if I decide to date her: her mom is dead, her dad loves me. He has actually suggested that I go out with her. He is heavily conservative, lets look at me from a trump supporters POV. I'm a straight, white, male, who knows my way around an engine enough to build a moterized bicycle at 14, I'm going to drive a race car next year. (Its a hornet dirt car. It's a pos 1996 Nissan Sentra with the interior ripped out and a roll cage welded in) My mom wouldn't let me hang around her anymore because she has 2 other older kids who have their own spouse and one has accidentally gotten pregnant before. My dad probably wouldn't give a shit. 

Then again there is the fact that she might not even like me. Who knows, maybe if I try to kiss her, I'll be bitch slapped into another universe. Maybe it'll go well, maybe it'll ruin everything.

Shes all I have left, all my friends are either dead or in hospital. If this goes wrong, I would probably not survive for long.

305507,"I dont think I've ever truly livedI dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived? 

I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me.

It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic.

I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."" 

It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."" 

(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",depression

now, back to today, i've completely flipped sides from that me, and i'm now very romantic, im pretty lonely and touch starved, and this girl i've known for a while but only ever thought of in a friend way messegas me on discord, and says ""i really like you and i have for a while"" which surprised me, i took some time to think about it and decided to friendzone her, it was a tough decision, but at the end of things, she had gone through 2 other guys only a week ago, and i don't want to be 3rd choice, i decided that if i were to date someone it would be because they wanted me before anyone else, but i'm not sure it was the right thing to do, because i feel like it might be my only chance to be in a relationship for a while. what do you guys think?

104586,"hi ! pretty much out of options by nowidk how to write one of these so sorry about that. im 19, i've struggled with depression for a long time, and im walking around with mostly untreated ptsd because i was raped some years ago. i've attempted suicide twice before and i've had many more close calls. up until spring i was feeling like my life was kind of turning around, i had a job and i had finally moved out from an abusive/unsupportive household, and i was generally ok all things considered.

i've been on the waitlist for a dysphoria investigation for about a year and a half, and in my country a dysphoria diagnosis is required to start hormone treatment. i was supposed to get my first appointment around spring, but because of covid that's been indefinitely put on hold, and the investigation itself usually takes 1-2 years, so it looks like it'll be several years more before i can even start hormones at this point.

around march or april i lost my job, and obviously there's a pandemic so there aren't a lot of job opportunities for an uneducated 19-year-old with mental health issues, so i was eventually evicted i think in may. my living situation has been tenuous since then, i was homeless/couch-surfing for a while and such. at the sort of low point of that i basically slept with a guy just so he'd let me stay with him, that wasn't exactly great for my mental well being either. now i've had to move back in with my dad who is vehemently unsupportive of my transition and a sometimes violent alcoholic.

so essentially: it will be years until i'll get to truly be myself, im stuck between either being homeless or living with my abusive father, and im depressed and dealing with the symptoms of ptsd. i feel like i'll never get out of this situation and i feel like suicide is genuinely my only way out of this, i don't think i can deal with more of my life. i don't have the energy to do anything about it even if i could somehow solve this, i don't have the energy for anything, i just want to lay down and disappear, have all the horrible things end. i feel very isolated and alone in this, i've lost contact with most of my friends and those i've still contact with i've feelings of guilt about them letting me stay with them earlier this year. so that's where im at. cheery yeah ?",depression

I don't even know why, what, when anymore. I don't know why I'm alive or why I'm not dead. I don't know why I still get up every morning, go to work, come back, go to class, come back, eat dinner. I do all I have to.

I'm even healthy, I've lost weight. I even did it the legit way, eating better. Vegetarian for four years. The best grades in college. Boys notice me more and I notice myself more too. I go to therapy. My mom calls me every night. I have a grandma who takes care of me. A boyfriend who sometimes loves me.

I don't know why it happens then. Why I can't cry now, why I'm writing and publishing this. Why I feel so damn alone and lost. What is the sense of my life, what do I keep fighting for. Why I'm doing something that's so wrong, and not feeling guilt. Why do I walk as if on automatic.

I felt I was going mad that night, dizzy because of the meds I took, walking in circles in my living room. Watching as life went on and nobody realized what was happening. I felt so confused.

Tonight again. I don't even know why I took it. I just got up and swallowed a pill. It's not nearly enough to overdose or kill myself, all it will do is make me relaxed and a bit dizzy. But why. What is going on, what am I doing, why am I doing it.

I feel like I've gone crazy. Every time I go out I want to catch a bus and disappear. Go far far far, where nobody knows me or my name. Start from zero. I'd like to not have to think, to just live. I'd like to find a reason why to live, something to fight for. Something that keeps me going.

I feel like I'm freaking crazy for doing this, but I can't help it. In my worst moments I know I would take anything that made me feel better. Anything. I only have 4 pills left and then it's back to nothing. I'm not going to buy it or look for anything else.

I have felt depressed since a young age and I've never really told a professional adult like a counselor or doctor or whatever. I have never wanted to die because my past self would say that I should never think like that but a little before the start of quarantine I started to think like that and every day it gets worse.  When home alone I would try and cut my wrists with the kitchen knifes because that was the sharpest thing I could get my hands on. It didn't really leave a big mark, It just looked like my cat scratched me (at the time she was still alive, R.I.P Molly). I started using the scissors in my room and that has left a mark a bit but it barely bled and then I took apart my pencil sharpener (not electric) and tried that but I stuck to the scissors and then I burned my arm with my hot glue gun and it had the burn bubbles and felt weird but now there's just a faint scar. Before I tried using everything else, when I was only using the kitchen knives, I told my mom about how I'm sad all the time for no reason and have tried to cut my wrists with the kitchen knives and she asked me if I wanted to die and at the time I didn't so I said no and she said that's good and then we hugged and I went back into my room to go to sleep. That was a couple months ago. Talking to her about that stuff was the hardest thing I have ever done. She never talked to me about it again.

IF SOMEONE COMES TO YOU AND TELLS YOU THEY HAVE BEEN SELF HARMING, YOU HELP THEM. YOU DON'T JUST SIT THERE JUST KNOWING THEY FEEL THAT WAY AND THINKING IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING. If you don't do anything about it, it's most likely going to lead to more and more and then wanting to die which it did. After confronting her she said that everyday we can meet and talk about how I'm feeling. The next day we didn't because she forgot and then forgot again and again and again.

I don’t want to negatively affect the rest of my boyfriends life, I love him and I want him to be happy. My mother, it would tear her to pieces. And my father, well it might push him over the edge with his already existing drug problem. My younger sister would have to live with the fact that her older sister killed herself. So I’m fucking living my pathetic life for others. I feel nothing anymore but sadness. It’s either I’m numb or I’m physically ill from the sadness. I’m exhausted. People say that not killing yourself for others is just your brains way of keeping you alive, but I don’t feel that way at all. I’m suffering. I want it to end. I can still want it to end, yet simultaneously care and worry for my loved ones lives without me. Fuuuuck I hate this",depression

313382,"I used to slather my penis with peanut butter or mayonnaise and get the family dog to give me fantastic head. 
Years ago, I used to live with family. We had a dog. He was a good boy. Smart, easily trained, affectionate, and loving.

One night during a summer, I found myself home alone with him. I was bored and horny as fuck. I couldn't get to a prostitute or a hookup, so I had an idea. I had once read a story about women and people who used peanut butter to get their dogs to do the work.

Why not? Let's give it a go!

I started out using peanut butter. Put it on rich and thick.

WHISTLES COME 'ERE, BOY. I GOT SOMETHING FOR YA!

WOW! Did the dog love it, and holy Christ did he ever do a good job! He licked the shit out of it and made me cum unbelievably. It worked great.

This became routine. The dog started BEGGING me for it. Somehow he started to know, whenever everyone went out and it was just him and I alone, what might go down. As soon as everybody was gone, I'd be sitting on the couch or wherever, and he'd start crying and sniffing around my crotch to see where his treat was at. Sometimes I wasn't even in the mood, but he wouldn't shut up. So I'd take my pants off, get the jar from the kitchen, and let him go to work anyway.

I started out using peanut butter but eventually switched to mayonnaise. The texture was better, and it was greasy so it provided more lube for his tongue.

Man, this dog REALLY knew what to do. I'd cover the key points on my penis in mayonnaise and reapply it occasionally and he'd go to town. I tried to keep him concentrated around the head and the frenulum. Eventually, he learned exactly where to stay without me directing him. I could just sit back with my legs spread, close my eyes, and pretend it was any woman I wanted. It was all automatic.

&gt; MFW I realize that I trained an animal to give explosive head on demand.
I had to make sure that we were absolutely alone because often I couldn't stop myself from moaning and screaming out in pleasure. His wide, long, wet, warm tongue was almost able to wrap completely around my cock in one stroke, in what felt like 100x a minute. He gave me mind-bending orgasms. So good that sometimes I felt like I was going to pass out.

It was heavenly. Just as good or better than a real blowjob. Why use hookers or sluts when I had the dog? He even somehow learned to tell when I was about to orgasm. He'd start panting and slobbering all over my dick as he licked furiously. Then when I came, he would wimper in excitement as he licked up and ate splurt after splurt of my load.

It was kind of a bonding experience. Afterwards when I had cleaned up, we'd sit together cuddled up, his head on my lap, and he was perfectly content to have serviced his master.

Sadly, he lived a long life but became ill in his old age. He got the diabetes and a few other things. We had to put him down. Maybe it was all that fucking peanut butter and mayonnaise.

Obviously, I'm not proud of this at all. Getting your dog to blow you and swallow your cum isn't something that's looked nicely upon.

But at the same time, maybe it's not so bad. People have been having sexual contact with animals for all of human history. The Greeks had a list of animals that you COULD have sex with and a list of animals that you COULDN'T, which was written into law. The Romans did it. They did it with farm animals in the Medieval period. Some European women were known for sex with horses during the Renaissance. Even TODAY, in some Middle Eastern and African countries, sex with animals is par for the course.

This isn't something unheard of. I didn't hurt or force the dog. He was happy to do it. And don't tell me that ""animals can't consent"" bullshit. I merely offered the dog a chance to lick my cock and sweetened the deal with a treat. He didn't have to do it. I didn't hold his head down on me. But he wanted the peanut butter and mayonnaise so he chose to tongue my head. That's consent. He was happy. I was happy. It was a fair trade.",non-depression

3666,"I just don't know where to go anymore.I'm so fucking tired of everything that is part of my life. More and more I keep succumbing to insanity and hopelessness. I recover, because I'm mentally strong. But I always return to this dreadful state. The time between being happy and unimaginably sad becomes shorter every time. My mental strength is fading. My bucket of hope is down to its last few drops. 

There is too much going on in my life and I can't take it on alone anymore. That is the problem. I've always been practically on my own. Left to my own self. In my entire 26 years of living I've never met anyone that I could really connect with. And If I did make any friends that I could connect with, the friendship would somehow water down over time. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this post. I'm so confused and plagued by all kinds of thoughts and worry that I can't write a coherent post anymore. Almost everything I try to undertake ends in either mediocrity or failure. I work so damn hard to make something of my life but every time life turns around the corner to kick me in the balls and crush my face into the ground. 

I'm not a real man. In my 26 years of living no woman has ever been interested in me. I can't see why since I'm not ugly or have a bad personality that I know of. Yet apparently nobody wants me. There is just something about me that turns women off. That's the conclusion I'm coming to. Never kissed a woman, been loved by one, never hugged or had deep conversations about life. Never made love. And yes I've date people and such, I'm not the kind of guy you think I am. I don't live under a rock or anything. Not that it would matter. I see all kinds of people ending up in relationships. Only I don't. 

I only have a few friends. One hand is more than enough to count them on. I know quite a lot of people and have a decent social life, but I just always feel like there is a glass wall between me and everyone else. Every time I put myself in a vulnerable position, I get hurt.  

I'm truly tired of life. I truly am. I don't know where to turn to anymore. I don't know what to hope for anymore. Hope for me, has always turned out to be a thing that only enhances my inevitable pain. And I just want the pain to stop.

I've come to despise the happy careless people that act like life is some sort of party and everything is fantastic. They seem to have everything worked out, but didn't have to do very much for it.  People like that have just been dealt good cards and don't know about the true world that surrounds them. Reality is a very cold and heartless place to be in for some people. I've stopped talking about my problems to a certain person from my family I trust a lot. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems anymore. 

I just want to be loved by someone for who I am. That, I've learned, is not a possibility. I don't know how or why, but I seem to be broken and unattractive.

167771,"Tonight, I'm finally going through with killing myself. AMA.Hi.

I'm sick and tired of it all.

The usual suspects: 

* I'm a 22 year old straight male from western Europe. No money problems. No girlfriend, a few FWBs.
* There are medical reasons for my suicide, but I won't clarify them because I know some people I know read reddit, and the last thing I need is for one of you fuckers to ""save"" me. 
* I've had concrete suicidal thoughts for at least three years. Pretty much permanently depressed for as long as I can remember.
* Yes, I sought help. First my regular doctor, then a psychiatrist. Attended for half a year. Kept describing someone else's problems to me.
* Yes, I've tried contacting a hotline. They were busy. Great. Doesn't really matter, since I wasn't planning on letting them change my mind. I've had three years of this shit already, I don't need any more.
* I realize I will leave people behind that will be hurt my by actions. Tough shit. There's a few people of which I *hope* what I'm going to do will fuck them up.
* My preferred method changed from drug cocktail to shooting to hanging. Shooting isn't an option because acquiring a gun here is ridiculously hard. Hanging is preferred to a drug cocktail, because it's more disturbing to the people most likely to find me. Hanging is done from an attic window. I have an old bed as a counterweight. Rope, with noose, is prepared. Suitable length for my height and weight computed. It's at least as good as I can get it given the information I could find.

I'm sick and tired of people telling me crap like ""chemical imbalance"" and ""irrational decision"". Fuck you. Life consists of good things and bad things, and the good doesn't even come close to outweighing the bad for me. I don't care that there's some girl I'm going to meet, or some incredibly rewarding activity I'm going to miss out on. It's all pointless hedonism. None of it is permanent. We're specks of dust. We get born, go through a load of crap, and die. I want to skip the load of crap part.

I'm sick and tired of random people telling me they ""love"" me, when they ostensibly haven't met me and have no clue what I'm like.

Other than that, AMA. ~~Limited time offer.~~

26175,"Coping after sexual abuse?Hey,

So, I've never really talked about this before, but here goes.


I was sexual abused from around 6-7ish? I'm not sure about the exact age, because a lot of my child hood has been blocked out. The abuse ended when I was around 11ish, which is probably when I started to realise that it was wrong.


He was a lot older than me. He was an adult, I was a child. He was a family friend.

At the time I didn't realise it was wrong. It's sick to even think it this way, but he made out we were boyfriend and girlfriend. He did this to another girl I know off, and she often referred to him as her boyfriend. I remember her being younger than me.

 I can kind of remember being confused and not really getting why we had to do these sexual things. I didn't like it and most of the times it hurt. The times he did take it too far, I would complain it would hurt and try to think about other things... Afterwards, he would tell me not to tell anyone and gave me sweets and play with me normally. It was like I went through with the abuse, just for the nice side of him afterwards.


I feel physically sick that I allowed this to happen. That I let him touch me and didn't tell anyone. I hate that I saw him as a boyfriend, it makes me feel so fucked up in the head. Like, why couldn't I have been the child to tell their mum what was happening? Why did I just ""go along"" with it?

So, we moved a way and I barely saw him again. He had a brief relationship with my mum (when I was about 14 or so) which made me feel I could never tell her. My mum absolutely adores me, and if she knew she had slept with someone who had molested her own child, I don't know how she'd react. She's suicidal, depressed and has Bi-polar... So growing up with a mother like that isn't exactly the best situation to be in.


I'm 26 now, and for the first time in my life I feel properly happy. I'm at university, I have an amazing girlfriend, loads of friends... But, my past is still there, ya'know? I've felt suicidal in the past, but I've always believed in my self to not let that chapter of my life win and wanted to push on and make something of myself.

I guess I'm just trying to say I'm worried. I haven't had any counselling for this or seen any help. I just want to try to ignore it and pretend it never happened, but I don't want to be one of those people that when their 40 odd, it all comes crashing back down on them. 


... I also find it really hard to talk about with people because I never physically stopped him. I feel like people will think I deserved it in some way because I didn't do more. I just feel so dirty and ashamed.

And recently, I've found out he has just had a daughter. This scares me to shit, the thought of him abusing another child. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel so useless atm, on the outside, I seem fine with loads of friends, my career/ect... But inside, I have all this welling up and I'm worried it won't ever go a way and I'll start getting suicidal thoughts again, or fucking up my life.


On top of that, I don't even know whether to go to the police. Would there be any point? Or do I just ignore it and carry on, because my life is ""okay"" now anyway?.. Sometimes I even pretend that it never happened, or it wasn't as bad... I'd even tell myself he never raped me, but I know he did...

340659,"Everyone hates me...I feel like I just jumped from one nightmare living with my family, to another living with my partner and their family, and I can't help but notice the common denominator.

Everyone hates me, and anyone who doesn't just doesn't know me well enough. Even my own sibling, who was my best friend growing up, never wants to speak to me again.

I don't even know why. I legitimately don't know what I do wrong all the time. I always try to treat people the way I would want to be treated. Sometimes I mess up, and I apologize and, if the other person is willing, move on. But sometimes I'll feel like I'm doing great, everything's going well, and then I'll get an angry text out of the blue complaining about something I didn't do, or something I didn't do well enough, or something I did do that I didn't even realize was rude or wrong...

And I feel like I'm crazy, I feel like I'm going insane or already am insane, and then I go talk to my therapist and tell them everything, I don't even hide anything because I figure what I've done is so heinous, they're gonna hate me anyway, even if I do try to embellish the story to favor me. But then I'm always shocked when they actually listen to me, and point out the good things I did, and say that I'm not an evil monster for feeling the way I do...

But none of it matters, because then I get out of the therapist's office (metaphorically speaking since everything's online now), and I go right back to feeling like a horrible, terrible fuck-up who mistreats everyone and deserves everything I get.

So everyone else is the issue, or I'm the issue and my therapist is just playing devil's advocate. It seems like the latter is more likely to be true. I thought the former was true when I ran away from my family, but then things were the same with the next family I tried to be a part of. (It's also possible that both are true.) If I leave this family, then either I'm alone or I join another family and fuck it up too. Why shouldn't I just do the world a favor and mercy kill myself?",depression

86429,"Chronic Suicidal Thoughts and Treatment Resistant Depression?Hi everyone! I wanted to post on here to see if anyone has had similar experiences and if so what has or hasn’t helped you? Or even just sharing your story is helpful! 

I’ve been struggling with severe depression (as well as an eating disorder, anxiety, and PTSD) since I was 10 years old. I’m 23 now, so I’ve struggled for about thirteen years. When my depression first began it was mostly manageable and I hid it very well. After a suicide attempt at 14, I was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility for the first time and had my first experiences with meds and therapy. Since then I’ve seen many therapists and psychiatrists. I’ve tried almost every available medication for depression. I’ve been hospitalized more times than I can count and I have been to numerous residential facilities, PHPs, and IOPs. I’ve done all kinds of support groups and I have even done ECT(3 full series), TMS, and Spravato (esketamine). 

Through all of those years of treatment I have struggled with frequent, intrusive, and often intense suicidal thoughts. These thoughts happen every single day and often come up in around 65% of my  thoughts throughout the day (if I had to guess). All kinds of methods come up in my thoughts and often something really minor can set off these thoughts to worsen. Mostly though the depression feeds these thoughts more than anything. It’s frustrating when you can’t find anything to help with this and I feel hopeless and alone in my thoughts. I feel like I’ve lost so much of my life to these thoughts and my mental illnesses and I don’t want to continue to lose more.

Please comment if you feel similarly, it’s just nice to know you’re not alone. I know that everyone is different, but if something has helped you let me know your experience. If you’ve noticed that there’s things that make it worse, let me know those too because I’m still trying to piece all of this together.

242724,"My Transgender Ex-GF is SuicidalHello Suicide Watch,

I understand a lot of people generally come here in hopes of preventing themselves from offing themselves but today I come to you in hopes of finding a way to cope with the stress i'm under which I fear will put me in the same position if I have to deal with it any longer than I have to;

I had been dating a Male-to-Female transsexual for the greater part of half a year now. We recently broke up because we had split apart for many reasons. The break up was in hopes of putting less stress on each other in hopes of reverting back to when things were simpler and expectations and demands of each other were a lot lower.

Anyway, I myself came to know my ex-GF by being transgender to a degree myself. I am a crossdresser, who is now questioning whether or not i'd be happier living as a girl fully and am seeking professional help with a therapist. As you can imagine, questioning your gender is a difficult situation to be in. But as my own personal gender issues came into the spotlight, our relationship had grown and we eventually became more than friends. We had a breakup before a few months ago because our relationship couldn't handle my gender issues. I don't know what I want in life, and she wants/needs a man. If I transition to female, I am obviously not a man to her and that's what she needs. Anyway after a week or so of having split apart and ruminating over it, she eventually over came her own personal issues of my potential gender change and that ultimately it was me as a person she was attracted to. This was back in late February. It's now late June and we're going through something else.

I know some of the things that have been bothering my ex-girlfriend lately which have been causing this behavior and at the same time I feel like I need clarification what she wants from ME as a person because I strongly feel that it is unfair of her to hang her own death over my head as some device to keep me to come to her aid. Though as much as I care for her as a person, I feel like I'm babysitting her and me dealing with my own issues aside from being transgendered is hard enough as I have trouble taking care of myself! I have told her that she needs help to sort out her issues. She feels like the world sees her as some freak, some fake, and a whole host of other things of that sort and that she'll never find love with a man who will never find her more than a sexual curiosity and conquest of sorts. 

She has been wanting Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) or Gender Reassignment Surgery (GRS) and intends to have it done later this year. I feel she is placing an extremely high amount of importance on this surgery as if it will correct or alleviate a lot of the issues she has socially and I feel that there is bound to be disappointment from it and perhaps could be her breaking point, which I fear greatly.

I have been telling her to get into therapy, get into therapy to discuss her issues, but she feels that if she does, her eligibility to get the surgery will be no longer valid because she is struggling with who she is or is trying to be. She's damned if she does, damned if she doesn't and I have no fucking clue as what to do.

What do I do?",depression

I went against my friend because there weren't any other people in my category. We sparred 3 times and each one had 2 rounds. 

First sparring we weren't really warmed up and were getting used to sparring (I mean we hadn't sparred in like 2 weeks). There wasn't anything interesting except the one time I hit a front kick to his face and him wheel kicking me after I tried to hop towards him.

After that there were 2 other sparrings while we relaxed.

Second sparring was a little better,he mostly dominated me. Our sensei told him to get into a clinch because I am taller and it was easier to throw kicks then step back for me at a distance. Immediately after the round started he tried to get into a clinch, I managed to get some kicks to stop him but eventually he got there and just ripped me apart. At the end I got a little mad so I managed to get a tornado kick after a roundhouse,but lost by one point.

He jokingly mocked me after he won so I was half mad half laughing.

I went ballistic on him the third sparring because 1. I was mad, 2. It was the determinative sparr 3. Sensei told me to get him into a corner and hold him there.

I ran at him which wasn't a great idea, that's why he welcomed me with a kick,after that I gave 5-7 unanswered kicks and held him in a corner. I was absolutely tired at that point but,as he told me after we finished,I hurt his leg,he was trying to rest so couldn't do much. He start winning me after he got really close. I managed to catch up giving my all into my kicks after he got tired. Then we had a ""golden point"" if that's a thing in english( I translated it directly so it can have a different name).

None appealed to me.

For some context, I'm sure I've done that before. I've been thinking about it for a while after all. I completely stopped hanging out with the three friends I had 10 years ago deliberately so as to minimise the impact on other people as best I could. In the intervening years I've come up with several plans and always figured that I'd go through with it when things got too much or I die of some other cause. Other than that I've done the bare minimum with life. I've worked in a supermarket two days a week for around fifteen years and that has been my only job. I still live at home. I've avoided getting close to people (which it turns out is easy). I just spend my time on the internet and using TV games as distractions but I'm increasingly growing disinterested in those (or starting new ones at least).

So I'm basically just waiting to die anyway. I figure I may as well get it over with rather than spend fifty years or whatever being unhappy.

196469,"I have $500. Do I go buy a new phone or a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson? I lost my phone today. Losing a phone - even a $500 example like a Samsung Universe Deluxe Whatever - is not really a general cause for suicide, but the resultant causes are. 

In lieu of a story, you get bullet points. Don't like bullet points? Fuck you. 

1. Depressed since 12. Had ECT age ~18. Worked pretty well, until...
2. Chronic fatigue syndrome/fibromyalgia/y'all fucked at age 19. I'd had chronic pain issues, but they'd been attributed to depression. Gained a lot of weight from sedentary lifestyle. Walked with a cane for a while.
3. At age 22, went on testosterone therapy. It's a shitty way of dealing with #2, but the quantity of tylenol I was using on a daily basis would have nuked my liver within five years. This reduces my lifespan by 10 years, not ~60, but now I'm sterile and terrified the benefits may well be temporary. 
4. During all of this, I sort of slogged through courses at my generic Southern community college. I transferred to a proper university via BS and dumb luck, but it hasn't gone well. Two semesters in a row I've had to drop 75% of my classes due to illness, one of which turned out to be a minor bacteria that just wouldn't go away. 
5. Oh. And I'm not actually accepted to the physics program I went to the school for. So I'm dropping out. With a ~3.1 GPA. 
5. At this point, I'm not doing my coursework, I barely leave the house, and have no further interest in living. It's honestly been about like this for years, but I just don't give enough of a shit anymore to even try. I lost the phone after an all-nighter and the dreaded afternoon nap (for mysterious reasons, sleeping less than five continuous hours leaves me Alzheimers'-level disoriented - I actually don't know what day of the week it is). 

A new phone and a gun of adequate caliber (it's the south - I'm not a gun owner, but fixing that takes about forty minutes) both cost the same. One of them, however, means I don't have to keep being miserable. Also, the gun is $25 cheaper.

Addendum:

Anyone telling me to appreciate nature, consider religion, see a therapist, or take drugs can go play in a woodchipper. I've done all that shit save for religion, which I have always considered beneifical only for those too stupid to live. ",depression
62332,"I tried to change myself completely, but nothing's workingWhen I was a kid, my parents pretty much raised me with the intention of sending me to an Ivy League medical school. They constantly held me to ridiculous standards in both academics and extracurriculars, and would constantly wheel me around from activity to activity and would expect me to excel in every single one. But I'm just a normal kid, you know? I was constantly stressed, and even from that age, I struggled to find anything that I enjoyed that wasn't eventually exploited and ruined for me by my parents. I was constantly compared to the kids my age around me, and any time someone who wasn't me was praised for anything, my parents would actually write it down, pin it on my wall, and repeat it to me a million times so I would adopt that same habit. I thought that everything I did was only a pathetic excuse for what my peers were able to do. 

Because I was constantly moving from place to place, I was unable to pick up any social skills. And it wasn't so much that kids in school picked on me as much as they just kind of stayed away from me. I was a very standoffish kid because I believed that every single one of my classmates was better than me. I saw everyone as my enemy because my parents had convinced me that my peers were nothing but competition.

My parents knew I wasn't being bullied necessarily, so they believed what they were doing was just fine. So this regular pattern of being utterly overworked and having absolutely zero friends continued until halfway through middle school, when I finally snapped. I actually still remember that specific day when, after school, I collapsed into bed and felt completely empty. I couldn't bring myself to do homework, eat, or go to club meetings. My parents saw me after work, scolded me for over an hour for being ""lazy,"" and literally forced me to do work (they stayed in my room that entire night and directed everything I did, and I was horrified). 

Over time, through the rest of middle school and much of high school, it got worse, and I began fighting my parents and secretly quitting everything I was involved in. I only had very few friends, and I was just such an awkward person that most interactions I had with my peers would cause me to cringe about it for several days afterward. I thought I was completely worthless. 

College acceptances were the worst. My parents were actually completely confident that I would get into every Ivy League school (not exaggerating), and uh...there was no way, considering that I had quit literally everything and my grades were falling. In my memory, I believe that was the first and only time that their abuse was physical, and right after, I attempted suicide. 

After that incident, I spent a lot of figuring out my own feelings, and I came to the conclusion that I had to change myself. I thought that if things continued as they did, if I didn't take that initiative to change what was making me unhappy, there was no way that I would ever be happy. So that's what I tried to do. I put myself out there by signing up for literally every single extracurricular I could, not out of a necessity to get into a good college or to beat out my peers but purely out of interest for what they were doing, and I actually began being more open with other people (not much at all, but it was definitely a start). 

I'm 19, and in my second year of college now, and I like to think that I'm a completely different person than who I was for my whole life. My friends know me as a memeable goofball that is passionate for the things he loves, which is a complete 180 from where I was before.

I go to a good university, I have good friends and okay grades, but yet, I'm still so unhappy. I'm still too competitive, even when I am completely aware that I'm being too competitive; I can't get close to people at all because I literally don't know how to not bottle up all my negative emotions and silently cry myself to sleep. I still can't bring myself to study at all. I study for all my important tests 1 hour before the actual test, and it's a habit that only makes me hate myself even more, but I literally cannot bring myself to change it. I still can't get close to people. I now have people that I can call legitimate friends, but I can't open up to them. Any time I feel rotten or so depressed I can't get out of bed, I just joke and ask them for notes instead of actually expressing what's wrong and how much I need help. 

Over the course of the past two days, my emotional state has been destroyed; my parents told me that they believe all the extracurriculars I've dedicated my time and heart to in college are pointless because they won't contribute to my career, and that I should quit them immediately. And more importantly, they are still trying, with every opportunity, to get me to change my major and go to medical school at an Ivy League. They are completely confident that they can still make it happen, and I know for fact that they will not stop pressuring me and twisting my emotions until I give in. They actually got me an MCAT book...for Christmas. Giving me nothing would have been better than that.

I just wanted to leave who I was behind and never have to look back. But it feels like I'm still...here. Somehow, ironically, everything is exactly the way they were when I was still in elementary school, just in a slightly different form. I alienate myself, feel constantly overwhelmed by any responsibility, and my parents are still trying to take control over my life. After trying to make such a big change in my life and failing to make myself happier, I've completely lost hope. I've been sleeping for 15 hours, every day, this winter break, and while I'm awake, I do nothing but wonder about how relieved I would be if I wasn't alive anymore. I feel like I have nothing to lose anymore, and that scares me a lot. 

Please help me. I don't know what I feel anymore. I don't know if I'm actually crazy or if I'm headed in any direction at all. I'm scared. I'm not even sure what I want out of writing this post. Just convince me that life is still worth living, please, somehow help me",depression
75078,"My moral and social view on suicideHi guys and girls,

I posted something which included the topic of suicide on another thread and it lead to someone reaching out through a pm.
My reply turned out to be petty long as I imagine it's, partially, what's constantly going through my head and I've never actually managed to verbalise it or write it down ever in my life.

It's slightly edited from the message to make more sense but you get gist of it. 

I have to warn you though, it is a long one
(That's wbat she said)


The way I see suicide is the way I see the ever ongoing argument for abortion. I dont know your views on the subject but I'm completely FOR abortion because it's the individuals right to do as they will with their body.
I feel the same with suicide. It's the individuals right to choose what they do with their body but, ultimately, what they choose to do with their life.
I also liken it to how we put down our pets if they are in so much pain or their life is not worth living because they are immobile and don't have any use of their legs for example so the pros for suicide out weight the cons which if we, as humans, can make the decision to put our pets to sleep because their lives are not worth living and the better choice is for them to not feel anything and it's the ""kind thing to do"", I certainly believe that we have the individual right to do the same thing to ourselves and make that decision for ourselves as humans. 

Unfortunately it's just frowned upon by society (like alot of things are due to most of the population just following the rest of the crowd to spread what is right or wrong as if its fact and not just the development of society. Hell, a couple hundred years ago society thought it was right to string women up because they thought they were witches. But that's a whole other discussion for another time) and also there's a good amount of the population that have the natural instinct to stop someone from dying or taking their own life. Unfortunately it's only when the deed is happening or is actually done that people take notice and think about their actions and how they could've done something or acted in a better way to prevent it, or at least show that there's some sort of good on the other side of life.

19967,"Advice from a manic depressive.As a Bipolar person. 'in curciles'. My Brother also. He goes up when he spirals, I go way way way..... way down. I feel guilt and manic depression. Luckily I have a strong willpower and (tricky myself into believing which is why the post) a strong moral compass.
So what I've learned is, basically if you really, not only want attention but truly just want to give up because you don't see the shamrock on the horizon, your body just starts to shut down. Any form of manic depression leads to a shut down of who we are. 
I get hives on my hands from stress or whatever and my organs (when I try to feel'em) are just giving up. 
SO take it or leave it, but...
The thing to do here is do all the stupid shit they told you!
Go out in nature and feel your poorly evolved (nature fucked up okay? it's not your fault) and try to get some sense of how your emotions and depression is leading to a shut down!
Grab a stick pull it apart, do some insane summer salts to get well.
Floss, even tho everyone as miserable as me just wants a bottle of whiskey and a kind person to take their hand and place an opium pipe....
Feel your body giving up. If you don't understand then you just need to tell your momma you love her and ask her to make 'er a sandwich.
If your truly manicly depressed like me then just give ""deep breathing"" a try.
It sounds like hopeful counselor office posters of advice stollen all the way from china and reformated but it's actually what you gotta do.
if it's the gears of capitalist society that's crushing you... get some SSI checks. They're present for a reason.

196272,"scared.I grew up as a child prodigy: always getting perfect grades, singing locally and pre-professionally, and being every parent's dream. Now that I'm older and the stakes are higher I can't cope with the pressure and I'm crumbling. I just want to make my parents happy again but I can't even give that to them because I'm just a shitty person at my core. Some days like today I barely eat because everything feels so terrible that even the foods that give me a sliver of happiness taste like mush. Sometimes I bang my head against the wall hoping that a switch will click and I'll be the person that they want me to be. I've always been a people pleaser. I've always done what they wanted me to do, so now that I'm not who they want me to be anymore, I don't even know who ""me"" is. I'm not good at anything I used to be good at. All the special traits I had that made me *me* are gone. Now I'm just a failure. My mom and dad always say that they'll support me no matter what, but I know that they've given up on pushing me because they're scared I'll break. I've gained severe anxiety and almost depression from the amount of pressure my parents have placed on me, but it never was like I was doing what they wanted me to do against my own will. I knew  I was good at what I did, I wanted to be something they could be proud of. I wanted their compliments and humblebrags on Facebook about my newest achievements. I love them so much and I want them to be happy. They've always loved me, and I've taken it for granted. Now that the dynasty of being a child prodigy is over, I don't know who I am anymore, and it's terrifying. I push myself to stay alive everyday because if I comitted suicide I could never forgive myself for doing that to my parents. I could never cause them that emotional pain. I'm strong enough to keep myself afloat. That doesn't mean that I'm not sinking, though. Every day is a battle within myself to not just sleep all day and pretend that everything is fine when it's not fine and I just want it to be fine and I feel so stuck and all hope is fading and I just wanna be happy again without worrying about the eventual tsunami of sadness that comes with it.

135106,"Depression and bulimia = suicideHi Nice to meet you! Right now i'm in need for your help. Your advice, your point of view and how you would have dealt with it if you were me. I'm a 22 year old male and i don't know if ill ever turn 23. For about 3-4 years i have been depressed and about 1 year ago my bulimia started. I suppose my depression started when i realized that i was stuck in time and everybody i knew moved forward, got a job, and started collage and lived their lives to max. I never completed highschool, im lazy and i have something called 'ADD' if i'm doing something that i dont like i lose focus and i decide to quit what ever im doing. The 3 years my friends went to high school i always tried to go to a school but it always ended up me being kicked out because i was never there. This happened 3 times to the point i was over the age for joining a highschool. After that i still tried and this time it was 'adult education' and yes, i failed that to, 3 times. I guess that im just too depressed to complete such task. And the school is not all the problems i have, i dont know if this happens because i'm depressed or if the reason if im just a terrible human being. I almost never like the people i meet, and they never like me. It's like im always finding something about a person that's makes me 'off'. I don't want it to be like that, i want to have friend, im really lonley. I don't have a job, i can get one from my dad but i always tells him no, cause the job is a really bad one, bad pay and i swim in mud all day. I want to have a job that matters to me, i dont want to be 40 and still have a job that i really hate. I dont want to spend 10 hours a day to me miserable. But i still dont know what i want to do, and you need to study to the most jobs today thats not 'shit'. so thats like 2 years to study my high school degree and after than then what? Then i need to go to collage for 3-5 years, and i dont think collage is for me, no i never went to highschool so yes, im kinda stupid. Everyday people think im stupid because i don't know certain things. It can be what ever, and i have a problem that my brain just freezes and i dont know the answer to REALLY easy questions. I dont really know if that's from my ADD or if im just stupid.
Now to the bulimia part, when i was 18 i was really fit, i was handsome and girls really liked me. But over the years i put on more and more weight and now im obesity. My bulimia goes up and down, some days i don't puke, others can be as bad as me eating then puking it all up, then i eat agen and puke yet agen. I really want to lose weight but the bulimia is taken over my body, i can't control myself around food at night.
I have small dreams but they are slowly fading away, one of them is to study japanese in japan. Another dream is to travel to australia or new zealand get a shitty job but just to live my life for a second. It feels like if i just left my home and my country that i just have bad memories of if i just left that behind for 1 year. And when i come back i have another point of view of life. My family loves me and they are always telling me to start to study, but i just dont know anymore, 6 times i have failed, what's so different about this time? And they have problems to, and i live with them so it's like their problems become mine, they always fight when my sister is around 'she is 11' and i always need to defend her and comfort her when she's sad. My mom is an alcoholic and dont even try to get help for it. Every night is a nightmare when she's drunk and they are fighting so my sister gets sad. The only time i can relax is when everybody sleeps, and its then i decide to get my reward, and that is food.
It feels like if i just had a little bit of courage in me, just a little bit, i would have taken my own life long time ago.
If you had my life, what would you do?
Please help.

314996,"Less empathy for ""scary"" mental illnessesI've noticed that the majority of sympathy towards"" those with mental illness is almost always geared towards those with mild depression and/or anxiety, as opposed to those with chronic depression, chronic suicidal thoughts, treatment-resistant depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. 

While I'm by no means saying that depression and anxiety are laughing matters,I am sick and tired of people with mild, easily-treatable symptoms being treated as the standard as if they have any idea what the rest of us go through. I don't think the people who suffer from anxiety and depression are the cause of it, so much as it is people who don't have mental illness. 

Take self-harm for example. If you have a few light cat scratches on your arm people will have much more empathy for you than the boy who breaks his bones or bangs his head on the wall or burns himself with cigarettes. 

Feel sad because you can't get a job? Have a little empathy. Maybe not a lot, maybe not from everyone around you, but from people who saw that article or that depression pamphlet who are starting to get it. Sort of. Hear voices? See things that aren't there? Always angry? Bang your head on the walls? Go into psychosis? You're difficult. You're a burden. You're an emotional vampire, you're an energetic drain. You should be locked away in a facility for the rest of your life away from good, ""normal"" people, because you scare them. You're a toxic person beyond helping. Feel a little bit anxious? Here, have a bit of empathy. Can't leave the house because you feel like you're dying? What a fucking bum, what a mooch. Can't keep a job because social interactions make you panic and have meltdowns? Waste of space, NEET loser, failure. 


I'm so sick and tired of people with situational depression who are magically cured, almost fully-functioning members of society trying to tell people like me why we shouldn't die. I don't care that one time you wanted to kill yourself in college because your grades sucked but realized that shit was easily remedied. I don't care that you went to an inpatient facility where everyone was loving and nice and read you bedtime stories and baked you apple pies. No one wants to be around someone who wants to kill themselves everyday because you went voluntarily and not kicking and screaming and never got a needle in the ass. No one likes it when you're clingy and have mood swings and have to be babysat everyday to make sure you don't off yourself. 

I struggle from an eating disorder. I make cuts in my skin that make people stare at me because my scars are thick and permanent. I'm always suicidal. I'm glad you went to a mental hospital and realized that all your problems could be fixed, by mine AREN'T. I'm glad you realized that grades are fixable, that being dumped isn't the worst thing ever, that you can always get a better job with your college degree.

My problems rule my life, and they're something I'll struggle with FOREVER, they color every part of my life. There are much fewer resources for people like me, and I'll never be apart of the ""conversation"" on mental illness, because everyone would feel better if people like me didn't exist to begin with. I scare people because they think I am contagious. I have no one to depend on, no social support, because no one I've ever met knows how to support me. 

I'm a burden on everyone around me. They wouldn't be better off if I was dead- just better off if I was never born to begin with. My family's lives would be 10x easier, calmer, less stressful if I was gone.

213005,"Happy or sad, suicide always seems bestIt was about 9 1/2 years ago that I said ""if I'm not happy with life in 10 years I'm going to kill myself."" I'm getting rather close to my deadline and despite the fact that there are slightly more ""good days"" now than at some points I still have no desire to live.

When I'm happy I just think ""man this would be a good day to end on, everything is going pretty good, and it's definitely gonna go downhill after this."" Then shortly after of course it does, and at that point I enter the more familiar depressive suicidal ideation. And no, that doesn't mean ""it will get better."" It just means that for every month of being depressed I might have a week of reprieve. The reason I set the 10 year timeline was to make sure that it wasn't a fad or a phase, since so many people make that claim.

Unlike a lot of depressed/suicidal people I don't have a lot of the more typical thoughts. I don't feel like ""I can't do anything right"", I don't think that ""nobody cares about me"", I don't think anyone has wronged me, etc. On the contrary I have lots of talents that I feel are going to waste, I have lots of people that care for me which makes the decision to kill myself much more difficult and frustrating, and I have had so many ""blessings"" it seems entitled to throw them away. 

However the modern world and society have absolutely nothing to offer me. There are no jobs that sound marginally appealing, and in fact I've cut back on working so much that I can't even support myself (which adds to my embarrassment/failure). Before when I was working enough, I was so miserable literally 100% of the time that I simply couldn't stand it. Figured it'd be better to be destitute and only sometimes miserable than making decent money and always miserable. I've tried dozens of jobs and quit them anywhere from a few months to a couple years. I see no chance that in 6 months my outlook will change.

What is the point of posting this? I don't know, I guess the same reason anyone else posts. To share my outlook in the hopes that someone else might associate with it. Or maybe someone out there has the exact combination of words to change my mind. Probably not.",depression
120605,"Why shouldn’t I kill myself due to social anxiety?I’m 21 years old and I have severe social anxiety, undiagnosed of course due to the condition itself. I’ve never had a girlfriend (kissless, hugless virgin) and haven’t made a proper friend in as long as I can remember, neither of which bother me anymore. I have just a couple friends that don’t live in the same town as me and I prefer it that way.

I struggled through high school well aware of my social anxiety, with the mindset that I would be dealing with it forever, but it didn’t bother me like it does now because I made myself believe I would somehow use my intelligence (top of my school) to somehow earn a living without having to interact daily. Since then I dropped out of university because I couldn’t handle the social interaction, and I worked at my parent’s small business that I also had to quit because I couldn’t handle the interaction with fellow employees. I’ve tried extensively to make money online too but that has only been a waste of money so far and now I have no more to invest. Now I’m coming to the realization that there are no jobs I can do that don’t involve any interaction at all with others. I’m expecting to hear that I should just get a job and it will supposedly help my social anxiety due to exposure: I’ve exposed myself enough to know it’s an immense effort for no reward, I just go right back to avoiding everyone in no time. And counseling, counseling is the biggest joke I’ve ever heard; if I was insane it may help in some way to help me organize my thoughts, but I am well aware of my options. The way I see it, I have two. I can force myself to live my life with this condition, living in misery as I force myself through social interactions, counseling and a hundred different pills with weird side effects, or I can end my life here which I see to be valid strategy. I just don’t think it’s worth all the effort and suffering I’d have to go through just to experience the good things in life, that does not make me depressed. Once my parents die I feel I can justify suicide, everyone else that cares should realize it’s my decision.

125165,"I don't deserve to live any longerI've been depressed since an extremely young age and severely depressed since middle school. Every single person in early middle school hated my natural personality to the point where a medium size group of students used me as their punching bag to mess with and bully on a daily basis. I eventually couldn't take it anymore so I created a completely false personality that I used to become more well-liked; I could never master it well enough to actually make meaningful friends but I became quietly tolerated by most of those around me. I basically functioned and blended in for a while until I eventually became so insufferably self deprecating and neurotic that even my intended fake personality was not enough to keep myself tolerated and I have since lost nearly all human connection and contact due to being unbearable to be around.
     Nothing that is a problem in my life was a result of unfair circumstances or the actions of others; I just failed to be adequate while given every opportunity in the world. I come from a middle class family and I was fortunate enough to have a very mild degree of inherent intelligence which I mostly utilized to please those around me by bringing home shiny test scores I had absolutely no passion or interest in obtaining. I even ended up getting into a relatively decent university despite being a huge piece of shit who never left the house or had any defining interest, hobby, or talent. Just from the orientation, however, I can already tell that I will not have any friends in college simply because everyone who attends the school is rightfully self confident, optimistic, and interesting, with unique and compelling actions and interests whereas I am just a slime-ball of paper stats without an ounce of individuality, substance, or authenticity. I even got bored enough to throw together a shitty tinder profile and after using it kind of randomly for a few months I have yet to be matched to a single other person; I was not surprised by this result, as I know another living being has never found me attractive, nor should they.
     The only things keeping me from killing myself right at this exact moment are that I feel it would devastate my parents who don't deserve to go through intense pain just because they happened to bring a shitty son into existence and I feel it would be insulting and ungrateful for me throw away the opportunities and advantages I have been unfairly given in my life. If I had the opportunity to give all of my fortune to another individual instead of wasting it I would happily end my life tomorrow and do so. Every day I think about suicide and create elaborate plans to carry it out but I never follow through with them because I feel it would selfishly hurt those around me and I don't deserve to have the power to negatively impact others' emotions. I am in therapy and on antidepressants but they have not helped me. I spend my days doing absolutely nothing sleeping and thinking to myself in my room, endlessly wishing I could disappear without harming the emotions of another living being in the process.",depression
284698,"A ludicrous yet serious story that is cause me anxiety and sadnessI don't know how many of you will read this, but I really feel the need to write because I think I am on the verge of a mental breakdown: 
I am a guy in my early 20s and sometimes I have considered committing suicide beacuse I feel stuck in a meaningless life, and I cannot see a ray of sun in this darkness.
A couple of days ago, probably out of despair/depression, I decided to tell a girl a follow on IG that she is the most beautiful I have ever seen; actually we don't know each other and she lives far from me; without (high) expectations I asked if she would consider having a coffee when she travels somewhere near me (she travels frequently) and she politely declined (understandably I guess).
I realise this whole thing is ludicrous and pathetic, but her reply caused a sadness that is shattering me; I don't know how to explain this feeling but I experience a growing sense of anxiety, and I don't know how to deal with it.
I don't even know why I am writing this post, maybe because no one knows me deep inside and no one could even conceive all this, given the image that I have given of myself",depression

134381,"I don't think I can handle this feeling much longerI have experienced the happiest moments of my life with someone I think Is the only one who Is right and belongs to me in other words, my soul mate.

Oir relation started as adultery, bc he is/was married and with 2kids. For one year I gave all of me, all of my support we made stupid mistakes, lived in LA LA land way to get much, and he someway he treated me like shit, putting me away on hold

Until a couple months ago I exploded when he couldn't go ahead with his divorce over some bad trauma he has with his parents and daughters. In here I attempted to harm myself several times etc... And call it off, went to therapy.

I re-connect with myself, gained self esteem and months later talked again with him in terms of how our livs were, conclusions we made, were did we went wrong and If he had really gone doing therapy, was a changed man, th man that I deserved, I was willing to gave a 2nd chance, because I really saw an impossible improvement in his mental health (and in his own alone time period he went trough heavy shit)

At this moment I am waiting for him, literally, and It will be the last stand and opportunity. I love him to dead I am a mess without him, the life is tasteless e even with good friends, nice evenings... In the end my thoughts always go to him te only person who completely understands me and whom I share an intimacy and trust like no one else in this planet, after 3 months of no contact, being with other guys try new things, work for me... I came to the same conclusion, no one will make me happy like him despite all the shittorm around us. I usually say that he Is not a happy because e doesn't want to be, because I will be always with him if he assumes me as his equal, parter, the only woman in his life.

As I said I am waiting for him to return tomorrow(he his returning from a psicological therapeutic clinic) , and all is this and other important things have been discussed. I have abandonement issues and a sixth feeling that tells me he will rertun not mad in love to be with me, touch me, see me, kiss me but instead still trapped in the web of past traumas that he simply can't see that will destroy is future, as much as it cost to take the first step..

Everyone Is cheering for us and hopping for the best... I fell hollow like I am about to go to the guillotine, to have the confirmation that my love was not enough a d he does not really love me like I do, despite our confessions that we were only 100% happy with each other...

I can't stop crying for 2days. I am in overdose so I don't colapse. I love my friends I have a good therapist, but no one understands this feeling of loss, of knowing that that's the only person who will make me happy... There Is no ""other man, Mr right, give it time"". Fuck I am tired of that word time... I want to be happy and now,.

So tomorrow if things go to hell and I can't, I don't want to keep fighting I don't want to go that path of get motivated because my reality is not that one. 0 connection to my family, very good friends but they can't give what I really want and need, professionally I do my best but for what? I will still be miserable as hell.

Years ago I would be the first person to say ""you don't need a man to be happy"" which Is true... You need you other half and when the other half can't be with you even though you are in your darkest time we'll Idk... For me Is simple I have nothing left to do here

Everything I will experience will be like the 5 minutes of fame, and then misery all over again. Tomorrow the faith of my life will be decided, and it's all in the hands of this person.
If I end up alone again I can't see the point of continue with my life there Is not anything else, ai just think I will go stop the car at the bridge and jump... Or to be less dramatic as soon as I arrive home swallow a hole bottle of pills during the night so next morning there is nothing that can be done.

I literally don't want to live in a world where I have to keep struggling and fighting and going to therapy just to have a glimpse is a sunshine ray at a random part of the day.

64030,"Any of you get suicidal thoughts out of nowhere?Just wanted to ask before I go to sleep.

Over the past few years, there's been a lot of changes in my family that I'm still not used to. Everybody has moved on but I haven't. I've been told that I should do the same but I can't. I'm still angry at certain family member because they're the cause of the biggest change. I'm confused and upset by all this which is making hard to get passed it. When somebody does something that affects the entire family and you, its clear that getting over it isn't an option. Why do people act the way they do?

I've been like this since 2015. Before then, I've never had thoughts of suicide and cutting. I never thought that I'd start hitting my arms because I can't hit someone else. I didn't think that I would have to debate whether or not I should off myself.

Every now and then a suicidal thought will come out of nowhere and linger in my head for a long time. Same thing with cutting myself. I think about cutting even though I haven't done it. When I get these thoughts I wonder if I should live. Recently, I thought about not eating but that has to do with something else.

Do this happen to you? Sudden thoughts of suicide or harming? I could be happy then I'll abruptly think about suicide and it'll bring down the mood. I'm not sure why this happens but I'm positive that other people experience this. Could my mind be telling me that I'm not good enough? I don't know if I want to end things or cut.

198992,"So it's been over a month since I tried to hang myself. (very long)The evening before this happened, I was having a very hard time at work emotionally speaking. It seemed as though every little thing was setting me off: too many packages coming my way? Rage. Running all around the warehouse to fetch something for someone? Anger. Dealing with my cousin on the phone? Let the waterworks flow forth. It was at that time I made the decision to end it all. I was finally going to do what I had talked about doing ever since I was a little kid. There was no turning back. All of the frustration and heartache I had been dealing with in my life finally came to a head. 

It had been several months since my grandmother had passed on and I had made the decision to sell her house and start life on my own at 28 years of age. But let me tell you, nothing in my life had prepared me for this moment. I had lived secure in the knowledge that she would be around for a good long while and that by the time she was ready to go I would have my life either figured out or I'd be long dead before she got to see what a waste of a human being I had become. But then the Pancreatic Cancer hit and for two years she lived with the specter of death looming overhead. For the first year things were great: the Chemo was doing the trick and she looked to be in great health despite knowing that the Cancer was a death sentence and all we could do was stave off death for as long as we could. But once it stopped working and her tumor markers crept back up, that was the beginning of the end. Seeing my entire life slowly crumble in front of my eyes while I helplessly watched this all unfold tore me apart. She was all I had left; The last vestige of familiarity in a world I was vaguely aware of. I thought that maybe she would somehow find the strength to pull herself up out of this dark abyss and find the resolve to get herself well again. But in the span of literally one week, everything deteriorated so fast I couldn't believe my eyes...

I woke up that morning with a resolve to hang myself with my belt when I got home from the gym. I walked in the door and first took off my belt. Where to do it? The doorknob was way too low and I didn't want to burden my lower body with that awkward angle. Ah!  Here we go! I tied a big knot in the end of the belt and shoved it in the door frame and made sure it would stay like that, grabbed a small stool and dragged it over. 

This is it. I finally had come to peace with my destiny. I could no longer run away from it. This was in my blood; in my DNA. Driven not by consciousness but by pure genetics. My mother tried to kill herself twice in the span of one year. Once with a gun (she shot herself in the stomach while she was 7 months pregnant with me and it almost killed me in the process) and the other with a handful of pills. I remembered the story of the second time she did it: her father found her on the kitchen table with the empty bottle near her hand. They rushed her to the hospital, pumped her stomach and as soon as she was well enough, threw her in the Psych ward for several days for observation.  I even reminisced about when I was 18 and was talking to her mother on AIM. At one point she was cross with me about driving to see one of my cousins whom I had only heard about in passing my whole life. It then escalated to her telling both my cousin and myself that she wanted to kill herself and that we wouldn't have to deal with her anymore.  I had a feeling she would not go through with it but still it gave me pause. Now I know where my mother got her suicidal tendencies from.

So now I wouldn't have to burden anyone with my mediocre life, of always trying to be someone I'm not. Of always having this lame part-time job, never being the big tough sonofabitch both my father and grandfather were, never getting to experience the joy of having someone fall in love with me and having friends and worthwhile life experiences. I would no longer be a disappointment to myself and others. I would finally be rid of it all. My grandfather used to say that people who were depressed and got help were weak. I didn't want to be weak. Not to him. But enough was enough.

I wrapped the belt around my neck while standing on the stool and kicked it away. As I hung there and things started to go numb and dark, a flicker of something in the lower part of my brain screamed at me... ""WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING??"" I then frantically reached for the stool before I could pass out and regained my footing.  I stood there gasping for air and finally realizing what I had tried to do. I cried for what seemed like an eternity until I had no more tears left. I took a few breaths, looked at the belt I had thrown to the floor, said to myself, ""Well shit..."" and made myself some breakfast and went about my day as if it had never happened. 

I wish I could say that I had had an epiphany and resolved to better myself for both my benefit and for my family. I wish I could be like alot of the others on here who have tried this and used it as a big wake up call to figure out what went wrong in their lives but in my case that is not so.  I am still quite morose, although I will not try anything like that again. I am still stuck in my shit job but I am trying my best to continue on with my hobbies, if for nothing else than to keep the bad thoughts away.  I am still very much alone and will always be so. I am finally coming to terms with that aspect of my life. I'm still a pretty lackluster individual and will always be one but still... With all that being said, I may not matter to anyone but myself but right now I'm all I've got left so I'll have to make the best of it.

I have no idea why I wrote all of this out. I guess it's just my way of telling someone that I'm still here and that I (hopefully) won't be going anywhere anytime soon. ",depression
300539,"it didn't get better.Preface: I find talking about this sort of thing unbelievably difficult. I have been a person that has hated talking about his thoughts pretty much my whole life so, uh. This will likely read disjointed.

I'm 30, as of this year. I've failed at every career I've attempted. I'm gay, but I'm the type of introverted, dumpy, depressed guy that everyone ignores. (I'm in a LGBT-friendly city and have been to bars, so, no, it's not like my location is bad.) I'm ugly and short. The few ""big creative projects"" I pursued in my life became laughing stock embarrassments. I've worked my fucking ass off to try and ""be happy/successful"" and all I have to show is insurmountable debt, bowel problems and testicle torsion. In my quest for anything I've gotten nothing.

I have no family. My friends are great but it is increasingly clear that I'm simply the burden in the group. A group of excessively intelligent and talented individuals that I could never hope to compare to.

I'm really good at bitching, I guess, reading back at what's above. That seems like it's it, for me.

And it's not going to get better. It has arguably gotten worse as I've gotten older, despite syrupy feel good anti-bully campaigns trying to tell me otherwise. (Perhaps I was always too cynical for them, though.) If I didn't have a fairly okay dead end IT job within walking distance, I would not have a source of income. The one I have feels like a scam somehow, and it doesn't pay enough for me to save up to get a car (I haven't been able to afford a car since an accident I got into years ago) but it's keeping me afloat.

I've been almost exclusively kicked around by life and it seems incredibly unfair to me that I am just supposed to continue to take it when there is absolutely no chance or opportunity for it to get better.

I... worked on this comic project for 3 years. 3 years of my life was spent pouring my god damn soul into this thing. The thing about having stats for visitors is that you get to see reality. I think I'm realistic, but maybe that's the tricky thing about depression. Regardless, numbers tend to not lie. I had a reasonable start traffic wise, but it wasn't going anywhere. Then a game came out semi-recently that did very well and it did a concept that I was going to incorperate in my project very well (much better then anything I could do, frankly) and between watching dwindleing interest in my own work vs. the overwhelming success of this media's use of a somewhat similar concept... I had a breakdown. I deleted the comic off the internet and have just kind of spiraled ever since. Years of my life and energy gone forever.

It's been months now. I have not recovered. I know this logically. But that side of my brain is losing out, every day. I wasn't a terribly happy person before, but I had a lot of hopes and dreams riding on that thing and all the colour of my life just drained out all at once. 

This is so rambly. I tend to bottle things up when it comes to stuff like this, so... I'm just kind of sitting at work right now. Hitting keys. Exhaling. Stupid shit.

I don't want to just keep being this shitty failure. Younger kids that are depressed get to at least have hope. I don't get to have that. Most of my life is gone now. I wish I had killed myself sooner so I wouldn't have to be me, now. The single hardest thing for me to do is wake up and realize I'm still the same person.

I don't know man. I just googled shit desperately and saw this place and wrote so that my hands had something to do. I could keep going, but even talking about it seems so stupid. I'm just some idiot in someone else's world.",depression

He knows it's a problem, but he is doing very little about it and I'm wondering if it's because he might be unhappy with me. When he's stressed out it makes me stressed out. 

I'm currently going back to college switching career paths and don't feel like I could support myself if things with my husband end up not working out right now before I get my degree. Even with my degree I know it might take a little while for me to get a job afterward and I'm worried I might never succeed, because my degree is in graphic design which is pretty competitive. On top of that, I just really don't feel like I have much to live for. I don't have any friends I feel a real closeness to. My husband is who I used to consider my best friend, but even we aren't connecting well anymore. And, my family and I aren't very close either. I don't feel like I have anyone to lean on in this world. 

I just don't want to go through life with the mediocrity and the deep, physically painful unhappiness I feel nearly constantly. I would totally commit suicide if I knew a guaranteed way that wasn't painful, but alas I am unfortunately not intelligent enough to even figure that out. I am stuck on this world completely miserable, and I want to escape so so badly. ",depression

When I'm in lectures or doing work or around people, the thoughts just enter some sort of back room in my brain. They don't leave nor fade, they just don't show themselves for a while.

The only thing that brings me genuine joy and excitement is learning new languages and I've been using that as a distraction. It works 99% of the time. And I'm super proud of my progress so far! 

But today just feels like that 1%...I never reached out to anyone about my depression and suicidal thoughts except for one friend. I vented for a while and he gave the normal responses like ""I don't want to see you go"" or ""I'm going to be sad"" or ""I'm uncomfortable with the thought of you killing yourself""... I told him straight out that his reply was flat and sounded like a broken record. We said goodnight to each other after I was done venting. He wished me the best. 

He never checked up on me again.

I don't blame him however. I wouldn't want to deal with me neither.

I have a date set out but I'm still unsure if I'm going to go through with my suicide. I feel so scared sometimes when I think about it, although it does give me a slight sense of comfort when I think about death.  I'm just scared of the pain, is that weird? I've had that question popped up each time I think of suicide.

I dont know if this is the right subreddit for this, but idk what else to do. She always acts like she is my parent and enforces so many rules on to me and always argues with me. Just yesterday, she kept arguing with me over small things, like when I was making tea she just had to start an argument that I wasnt allowed to use the sugar (And mind you I was just tired from school and couldn't handle anything else for the day). She turned this in to a full blown conversation where she started shouting and swearing at me because I was giving little response to her claims (I was allowed to make tea with sugar, so I just said I can make tea). 

Then she blamed all this arguing on me never having a conversation with her or whatever. She told me I was not taking this relationship 'seriously enough' and I responded that she was taking it 'too serious'. She might have been right about the conversation thing, but honestly, I think I dont like to talk a lot after school since I'm just tired and I am a teen and an introvert, while she has the exact opposite personality as me. So, I always answer any of her questions like what was you test like with it was good, or what did you do at school with the lessons I did that day. She says that I am the problem, even though I think she's trying to be way too involved in my life and always starts arguments with me. After she snapped yesterday, she started tatteltaling to my mom, everything I do. Which was impossible to deal with since I was trying to study for a test I have the next day (today). This ended in me going to sleep early, but before I went to sleep, she told me that I have to come to her tommorrow with a written statement or some dumb shit like that on what I will do 'to improve this relationship'. So that is where I'm at. I'm tired of her always being like this, but I dont know what to do. I feel like she should change, but when I told this to her, she was shocked that I hadn't noticed her change 'saying that she always used to tattletale and argue with me' but now she doesn't. I was just as shocked when she told me this, I feel like she hasn't changed one bit. 

Anyways, now I have to come to her with a written statement on what I should do tonight, which is where I need your guys help. I've never confessed anything like this before, but I don't know what to do.

Ive been fighting this for over a decade in hopes that it would get better, but every day it gets worse. Why continue life when I have the power to end it?

The worst part of my day is when I wake up because life hits me and all of the painful memories gnaw at my entire being.

Each time took a little more of my trust in women. Now this trust issue has completely destroyed the relationship I was in till about two weeks ago. She's left because I'm to safe basically, I'm not exciting enough. I don't take risks. And now she wants to leave, travel the world, sleep around, and apparently become a camgirl. I've been to multiple counselors. Many have said my panic attacks that happen on a daily basis may never go away. They treat the symptoms instead of the cause. My dream of settling down, having a family, doing the job I love, all seem to impossible to even bother. Every day I sink further and further. I still live with my ex, and we still get along. All this makes it even worse. And I can't go to her for help. The last thing I want is for her to stay out of petty. I've already written my note.

I don't clean up after myself, I don't bathe myself, I just either sit on my ass, typing away on this computer, or lay in my room, playing video games and sleeping.

I was asked to do one thing yesterday, and it was to help clean up the soda cans in my room, as my dad was going to do the recycling that day. I hardly got three cans done until I broke down and my dad had to do the rest for me. I laid down for the rest of the day, just hoping to go to sleep and never waking up.

My bed is a mess of plates and bags and I stared at them, feeling no need to clean it up at all, even with me feeling like shit for not cleaning up.

Thoughts of what I did in my life to deserve such atrocities and be forced to live my life as I am. I lost my entire family, lost nearly all of my friends. The few that stuck around are more, fare-weather-benificial-selfish assholes. I've tried to kill myself a few damn times and failed miserably. Back in 99 after losing my grandfather who was the only father figure I had in my life. I decided I wanted to join him. So I took 100 pills (not going to say which ones... Because well yeah. I'm not an asshole) but I ended up in the ER on deaths bed, unfortunately we know how that ended up. Tried to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, that ended with the biggest mind fucks of all time. Then a few months ago I tried to hang myself. I remember blacking out and going completely limp. Woke up on the floor.

Suicide hotlines are a joke. I'm sure they help some people, I text the crisis line sometimes, wait an hour or 4 and by the time the person gets on the phone, I feel I'm talking to a robot. No emotion, no ability to speak on how I really feel in fear of the police coming to snatch me up. I suffer from severe depression, bipolar 1, PTSD, anxiety, stress. I've recently been diagnosed with PTSD so it's a learning curve but it's getting harder and harder for me to survive each day. I will be 40 soon, I have absolutely zero.

If I died tomorrow, I wouldn't have anybody to come claim my body and to bury me. I would sit in the morgue for weeks until they stick me in a pauper grave as just a number. My ""friends"" wouldn't care enough to do it let alone show up to a funeral if there was one. I haven't heard anybody tell me they love me in almost 9 years. It's such a horrible feeling knowing you have been completely forgotten about in life. Knowing nobody cares enough about you to tell you they love you. As much as it hurts it helps me in my fight against myself in the never ending battle between life and death.

All I can do now is pray a helicopter, airplane, cement truck, meteor or comet comes crashing through the roof and hitting me. My luck I'd probably survive as a head and partial torso and right shoulder. Suicide and death are two things dear to me. I wish I knew life and love. But I guess that's life right?

Most of you are familiar with Schrodingers cat, you know how the cat who is in the box is 
both alive and dead at the same time, in the superposition of two states. Until this cat interacts with our world, the cat is indeed dead and alive, but not both. Physics cannot explain how the particles or the cat goes from being simultaneously in two states to being in just one state. The Many worlds theory however suggests the universe itself doesn't choose but at ever major incident where the larger particles interact with the quantum system, the timeline we know is split into two separate realities. This means that both possibilities will take place but on separate branches of time. This continues to happen every time a 'crossroad' is reached, for example, until there is a universe for every single possibility you could imagine. This leads onto quantum immortality, which in short refers to the phenomenon that you could simultaneously die in this universe and continue to live your life in another, due to the infinite number of universes co existing side by side, it is possible, granted the many worlds theory is correct, that they could briefly overlap the second your die in one universe, and transported to the same point in that universe when the death never occurred. In essence, it means that your consciousness will stave alive even though your body and conscious being will die. 
Why am I telling you this? Well, I'm a strong believer in this theory, so take comfort in knowing that I'm probs just kicking it in another dimension where none of this shit happened and I'm gucci.

80227,"I see no reason to continueI am a 23 year old female and I got divorced in March just as the pandemic started. We were married for 3 years. He convinced me to date him, to marry him, despite my hesitation. I should never have given in. All that love, all those years were wasted. He was a terrible husband, even though I would have done anything for him. Never one gift, not even on my birthday, never one thoughtful moment, so much anger, so much dismissiveness. I was depressed during that last year of marriage, but he never really helped me. I had no job, because he preferred me at home, I was scraping by in college, losing all my friends, gaining weight. He was my best friend and he just one day vanished... abandoned me, because I wasn’t well. I know I hurt him sometimes too, when my resentment became too much, but I really was unwell. Will he ever understand that? Probably not. He called me to tell me he wanted a divorce. He couldn’t even tell me to my face. He left me homeless during the pandemic, so I had to sleep on friend’s floors, until I got over my pride and accessed local resources. I tried to get better, even though all I wanted was to kill myself, I felt so so worthless after being thrown away like trash. I took the pills, I did the therapy, I reached out to friends, I exercised, I lost 40 pounds in those firs three months. I was making some progress, despite my renewed high school eating disorder, but less than two months later, before the divorce was even official, he’s engaged to a coworker. He blocked me on every platform. He acts as though I never existed. This stings so bad, because for three years, he became my whole world. I didn’t have anything beyond him. All wasted, all worthless. All that I devoted to him, he throws me out because I’m too sad, too difficult to help...

Worse still, I miraculously fall in love with someone else I meet. It happens slowly, but the connection is real. There’s lots of drama and mistakes, but the love was something I really felt... that I still feel. Yet, tonight I ended it with him. Despite how much I loved him, there were so many red flags: controlling behavior, purposely hurting me verbally, broken promises, lies. I knew if I stayed it’d never work out, that I would only be hurting, even though I almost didn’t care... I thought if I just want to die anyway, why not just stay and tolerate the abuse? But it’s too late to back out of the break up now. There’s no way he would ever forget this. I hate hurting him, it hurts me more than he will ever know.... but maybe he will, once I end it. 

I find no purpose in life. All I’ve ever wanted to be was a mother. I fought through college just so I could have a decent job just so I could afford to be the mom I wanted to be, but it’s nothing without a partner. I don’t think I’ll ever find a partner like that, to make a family with, that won’t lie or break promises or hurt me...",depression

My thoughts are racing and this post probably won't make sense as I ramble on and on. Forgive me if it's confusing. I merely write whatever sentences comes in next. It is even difficult to admit that I feel sad, thought it's a feeling I am very much used to. You see, I grew up sad but masked my life with happiness in the hopes that one day it will be true happiness. 26 years later, I'm still wrong and I can't handle it anymore.

I'm a love-child, or so we're called. An illegitimate son. ""Illegitimate"" is what I've been referred to for the longest I remember. That word itself makes me feel much less of a human being. Like I had chosen to be born the way I was.

My father had to go back to his family and mother had to work abroad and leave me to her sister. It was an abusive environment. I remember being beaten mercilessly so many times but I don't remember what for. I remember my aunt's husband saying ""He's just jealous because he doesn't have parents"" when I was 8 years old. I remember being treated differently because I'm ""illegitimate."" I remember all the pain and sadness even after two decades had passed. I can't shake it off.

Moving forward, 8 years ago my mother and I finally reunited. The most exciting day of my life. Today, she told me I'm not part of her family. She asked why do I hate my aunt so much and why am I angry. In all honesty, I'm not angry at all. I'm just very sad that my own mother wouldn't believe the stories I told her about how my existence to their family is basically a curse and I had to suffer for it.

I'm too old to feel like this. I imagine this sensation is only reserved for the ones who had suffered much greater pain than I have. Like losing a love one or something. And that I'm being a pussy for being sad about this shit. My mother coined ""Didn't you get cured for that already?"" Because I did go to a psychiatrist and that somehow should just take all this history away from me.

Anyway, this has been a wall of text and it probably doesn't even seem that important anyway. I can't write all that happened today because it wouldn't matter 15 minutes from now anyway. I don't remember my password for this account so I won't be able to reply. I'm sorry.

114100,"Fall from GraceI keep trying to get better. Unfortunately my concept of ""better"" is an elaborate schedule of arbitrary and enforced rules i create for myself, a routine that i attempt to develop and stick with for an extended period of time, 30 days for example. Some of my rules and routines have stuck around for almost ten years. I'm 25 and I haven't chosen an outfit apart from for a formal occasion in all of that time. My clothes are folded and ordered in intricate ways, with different rules memorised to complicate the matter. I have to remember the chronology of when i acquired every item, as this is the man backbone of the system. Then I have different rules for different types of clothes, different weather, days of the week. I'm bisexual so I even have this weird thing where on alternate days I dress to attract men/women specifically. Basically one day ill embrace what i consider to be my hetero side and the next my homo side on repeat for years. None of these probably close to 40 rules are written down, and those are just the ones for clothing which is only one aspect of my life. Sometimes i worry about how much mental space, focus and energy i use every day just to keep my systems alive.

Essentially the clothes are just an example. I make up rules for everything. The problem is that most are unsustainable, and don't stand the test of time. And when that happens its even worse. Every time a system breaks i fall into a deep depression. Usually I get up at 5am every day with my partner who is a builder and we hang out before he goes to work (I work in the evening, he works days , we don't always see a lot of each other). Today was my first day off work after 7 days on and i had a lot of personal goals and housekeeping that I needed to maintain today to keep my current system (estimated running time: 5 weeks. Basically a high score for me).  I also wanted to rest a little, so asked my partner to wake me at 6.30 instead of getting up at 5 with him.

He tried, he said, but he was running late for work. I woke up at 12. The house was empty. I woke up in fear and panic and ran through the house calling his name. I collapsed sobbing on the kitchen floor. (its possible i may have some abandonment issues). This is what I have always called a Lost Day. The day didnt start at the right time or even close to, the schedule/system is ruined. This is a failure. I struggle with self-harm and this is a situation where I had to work hard to control myself. I called my mum through sobs and stayed on the phone with her for 45 mins. She's very supportive but also very productive, and couldn't see why I could't start my day at 12. She said i was crying so much she initally thought something horrific like the death of my partner had occurred. It wasn't until after i got off the phone with her that I realised it was the death of myself. It was the death of the persona that I had been successfully manifesting for some time now that I was mourning, that successful (at least by my standards) persona is now gone. I have to wait for a fresh morning, sometimes even a fresh Monday morning, before I begin again. I can't make myself do anything if it does not have an impetus, a clear chain of events i guess? Most days I try to be good and start a new system, maybe one with a clearer focus on physical wellbeing, the next time maybe personal hobbies etc. However it can take days, weeks, or even months to discover a routine I can hold for longer than 2 weeks before the next depression slump.

I'm currently 16 and i'm a little over halfway through high school, and I really do not know how I am possibly going to graduate. I am failing about 3 out of 7 classes right now, surprisingly passing a few of them, and I failed 3 classes last semester while just barely passing the other ones. Suffice it to say, school is one of the main roots of my severe depression and apathy towards life. I simply cannot get through it. I have skipped so many days this year just because the sheer act of getting up and going to that damn building is just too miserable of a thought, not to mention the homework and all that nonsense. I just can't do it.

My current 'schedule' consists of 1. waking up as late as possible, 2. going to school and just trying to pass the time however I can until I get home so I can sleep, 3. eat too much food, 4. go to sleep and repeat the next day. I don't have any friends and my mom is about as unsupportive as can be (not to get started on my dad but he's not in the picture). She has this aspiration that i WILL and HAVE to go to college but at this point I know I will 100 percent either just kill myself or drop out if I do that. People say they give a shit about you, but that's only when it's convenient or when it makes them feel better about themselves. And the worst part is, I'm the same way. This is a facet of my life that has been a constant goddamn blemish on what little social skills I have. I don't know exactly what it is, but I honestly do not have the ability to empathize with others. I can't relate to anyone's emotions, and I don't feel them like anyone I've ever met. I don't have the mere capacity for regular human empathy, if that makes sense. That's another post in of itself but it's.. it's just shitty.

At this crosspoint, I don't know what I'm going to do. Everything takes too much fucking energy and no one gives a shit about me.

This is sort of related but I am also gay. Have known since I was about 10 and that is also another thing I 100 percent wish I could just delete from myself. I don't really feel 'lonely' as being around other people period is something I avoid at all costs, but, I just know that even if I ever wanted to be in a relationship, my dating pool is drastically smaller. Not to mention I am physically extremely ugly. 

I may get a job this summer, but I don't even know if I'll be able to do that. My only options I can even see at this point are to just a get a job and save up for a van or some shit so I can just live out of that when I evidently don't graduate high school because I'm a massive failure OR just jump into moving traffic because there is no goddamn way I am going to stay living with my mother when high school is or isn't over. Either way, my main goal is to just get away from where I am now because I really, really, really just CRAVE independence. That's about what it all boils down to, I am beyond unhappy with every aspect of my life and I feel like I have no control or angency over fuckall. I want my own money, I want my own place to live, I want a decent group of friends I can be happy hanging out with or something without school or my mom breathing down my neck waiting for my next move.

The last part at the end got a little bit venty, but I hope someone here can either relate or provide some decent advice. Either way, appreciated.",depression

What's stopped me from trying again is that stupid fear of dying - and that uncontrollable/unconscious bodily reaction that tries to keep you from dying.


But for the past couple of weeks I've been building up courage, practicing and getting comfortable.  I've always been afraid of heights, but for some reason, live in a penthouse apartment on the 23rd floor.  In the past, just going out on the balcony and looking down gave me that stomach-in-the-throat falling feeling.  But for the past month or so, I've been spending more time out there...looking over for longer periods, bending over the railing, jumping up and down.  And finally, last night, I crawled over the railing and sat on top of the railing with my feet dangling over the side.  I was still a bit freaked - and I'll probably do it again soon - but it felt freeing and liberating just climbing over the railing.  My body/mind wasn't controlling me anymore.


Eventually, I want to get to the point where my flight response - the fear - will be as dead to me as the rest of my feelings.  Yes, I'm in therapy; yes, I'm on medication; both of which are helping me be more and more objective about the pointlessness of both paths.

344402,"Attempting tonight, note encl.It’s astonishing to think about what people put up with. 

Some people stand under the burden of a mental illness for their whole lives, never reaching fulfillment… whether that be due to lack of ability, lack of respite from their illness, or simply being pumped full of mind-altering medication. 

Some people have awful families, and have to spend time with people who fake kindness, interest, and positivity, but who really are just toxic robots making their way through life wholly on their own regard. 

Some people never find their inspiration, never find a passion, and never feel that light in the empty space in their hearts. 

I’m one of all of those people. 

I’m not the person whom many think of when they think of a victim of suicide. I am not a victim of abuse, I am not an addict, and I have family and friends and money. I have potential for a future, a brain, a partner, a job. I have it all, and I have been reminded to count my blessings on many occasions. Fuck you, all who told me that as if it would cure my mind state. It just made me feel guiltier for the act I feel I must carry out. 

I am tired. I am lonely. I am empty. I often find myself unable to feel even the simplest of emotions. I must consciously notice what is happening around me, and dig into myself to find that flutter of life. I can find those emotions, but never feel them like I used to. I am a zombie, dead among the living. I am numb. I am in a fog. 

I am in therapy/counseling, and I have tried to feel. I try so hard, but I can’t seem to reach that level of function. It is simply beyond me. 

I am medicated. It works for a while, I feel a lift, but then the darkness reaches back in and around me and holds me down again. The lift doesn’t cut it. But adding more medication(s) seems to give me a tendency towards suicidality – not like that’s already my main concern or anything. And so I carry on, feeling more lifted some days than others, but feeling trapped in darkness and heavy numbness the majority of the time. 
Which is where I am now. I was lifted, but this cycle continues – up, hope, potential, but never reaching anything near happiness – and then a crash downwards. What the fuck is going on with me? Why won’t it stop? Why don’t medications help for longer than 2 weeks? And why do I keep returning to the same place that is promised isn’t a necessity, is maladaptive, isn’t human? 

Suicide is the most human thing I can imagine. Sheer brokenness and acceptance of one’s uselessness and inconsequentiality to all of eternity... Humanity is nothing. We are absolute shit and have infested the world with disease, inequality, pain and suffering. We pray to imaginary gods to save us from our shittiness, when, in fact, there is nothing that can help us or save us from the wreck that is ourselves. It is better for the least of us to die as quickly as possible. Thus, I feel the need to carry this out. 

I am nothing. I am useless. I am filth and disgust. I am worthless and inconsequential and a burden to the earth and to others who have more value than I. I pain others. I worry others. I am an expense. I am not worth the input that I am fed. 

-----

I’m sure whomever is reading wants me to elaborate on my first statements:

I am ill. I have accepted this long ago. My family, however, has not. [Older sister] called me “crazy”. Mom told me she “doesn’t like those drugs” [the antidepressants]. I have sought help. Yet to this place is where I continually return. 

My family (Mom, Dad and [Older sister], mostly) is self-centered and self-concerned, lacks empathy, and hurt me on a regular basis. I am fully aware that I am ‘the black sheep’, I know I am different, and I know that I contribute to some of the issues we have. But it remains that you are part of the reason for my turmoil. I wish I could never come home. I wish I never had to speak to you or see you. I want to choose my own family and spend time with only them, because it is difficult and painful to come home to criticism and judgment and disappointment. 
I have a tattoo. I have a nipple piercing. I’m stretching my ears. I want to marry my partner. I would tell you things like this if I wouldn’t get a talking-to about every single damn one of them. Do you honesty think I don’t think these things through? Do you really think I have no regard for consequence? I’m not stupid, and I’m my own adult now. I consented to each of these things, but out of fear, I have not been able to share them with you. Shame, fear, guilt… what else could you call this fuckload of bullshit? 
I want to share my life with you, but I have to fit into your mold first. I’m the black sheep, remember? I’ll never fit into your damn mold. Why can’t you just love me? Why can’t you just show interest in my choices instead of jumping down my throat about why they were “wrong”, or why you’re concerned? 

And, no, I have no fucking inspiration. No light, no fire, no goddamn speck of hope. I have no reason to carry on fighting if all I see is bleak and dark and black. I see no reason to continue. I have no life left. My family, school, money, babies, a future – none of them are worth fighting for. They are the smallest of desires in my mind compared for my desire to cease to exist. 
My partner – [Name], I love you so so so dearly. You are beautiful and everything I have ever wanted in a person. But my feelings aren’t coming through. I know they are there but they are cloaked in fog and darkness and I can’t grab hold of them. I’ve been fighting to – you know I have. But it’s not working, and I don’t think I deserve this torture any longer. 
It is better for my frail soul to end. 

-----

Mom, Dad, [Older sister] – relax. Stop judging. Stop jumping down people’s throats. Stop approving or disproving everything the people walking past you on the street do or say or dress like. Stop caring about other people’s business. Back the fuck out of it. 
Goodbye. Thanks for teaching me all about guilt, shame, hiding, lying and hating. You have made me a master at the craft. 

[Younger siblings] – I’m sorry. You did nothing to hurt me or to deserve this pain. I’m sorry that I am leaving like this, and causing the family sorrow and torture with my words. I’m sorry. I love you both.  Goodbye.

[Partner] – I do love you, and I am so so so sorry I am leaving like this. I’m sorry that I’m doing this again and putting you through this again. Please know it’s not your fault, and there is nothing more you could have done. You are an amazing girlfriend. Please take care of yourself. I love you. 

[Partner's parents] – You are both amazing, and I’m sorry for leaving like this. Thank you for helping me. 

[Psych team]… I appreciate you both so much. Thank you for trying to help me. 

[Bosses] – have you figured out yet why I wanted to quit? 

To everyone else that thinks they matter enough to be mentioned in my note – you were as inconsequential to me as I am to the world. I am sick of faking friendships when I don’t have the energy to. I cannot uphold my end of the deal, I guess… I may have told you I cared, etc, but really, I am so burdened and pressured by the weight of simply living that I could not afford to simply care. I do not care about you because I am a wrecked shell of a person. I am a useless hunk of shit that cannot even support a basic friendship or two. That’s not your fault. It’s not your fault I haven’t loved or mentioned you. It’s because I am so damaged and ruined. I’m truly sorry that you didn’t matter to me more. 

-----

The reasons I’m sure you think I’ve made this choice are likely wrong, by the way. It is simply what I have described – not that I’m gay, or different, or fat, or lonely. I simply have no drive or desire to try to be something in a world of shit. I am the bottom of the barrel and see no potential, and think it would be easier for everyone else if I died. That’s it. 

In short, I hate life, see no reason to continue it, and will therefore be ending it. 


Goodbye.

Im 16 turning 17. I despise my parents. I have two jobs (tutoring), but after june 23 i am going to work elsewhere, and i currently maintain a 93 gpa. That however is not enough for my parents. My sister and I would fight all the time. Her being 6 years older then me. When i was twelve she broke 4 of my teeth when she was punching me, causing infection and cavities because my parents didnt take me to a dentist until two weeks after. I have 5 root canals done thanks to obamacare, but my teeth hurt so much everyday, sometimes the pain is unbearable even with motrin or tylenol. After my moms dad died back in 2010, it has all gone to shit. She is batshit crazy, emotionally manipulative, and extremely selfish. She has always been but hid it well. I told her once when I was 8 years old about what my sister did to me, i drew a picture and wrote as best as i could because i was too embarrassed to say anything, she just laughed at me. That really fucked me up. I was confused as to why she didnt want to help. I wanted to kill myself when i was 8. My mom is extremely religious and thought i was the devil. I hated church. I was an accidental baby and i know for a fact i am not loved. My parents are middle class and they have a good amount of money, but only spend it on themselves and my sisters college. I felt so ugly wearing my sisters hand me downs, i just want nice things and although im not materialistic i just dont want to look like shit. I got a scholarship to my school and everyone there is rich. I dont fit in. Ive done disgusting things for money but thats the only way i can buy my own clothes, necessities, and books for school. I make about 80 dollars a week tutoring which mostly goes to drugs. My parents dont let me leave the house and they complain that all i do is sleep.i go out once a month and dont come home until 6am. My parents resent me for this and make me feel like shit and then my mom bitches about how much money she put in raising me and she just wants me to have a good life. Fuck that selfish bitch. I thank God school is over so i dont have to be locked in my bathroom sized room studying 3 hours a day. I recently found out my father masturbates to me and i just feel so weird. My dad is never home. All my boyfriends have have been controlling. I felt so heartbroken when my alcoholic ex boyfriend (the only person ive ever loved romantically) got a bitch pregnant. Fucking alcoholics. Anyways, i have nothing left to live for except drugs and although the cutting is soothing its not enough to end the pain. I am thinking of killing myself after my sister leaves for summer break because although she has done that to me, we grew up and she is like mother to me now. Isnt that twisted?

Did you ever had the feeling that you never lived life as you wanted it to be deep inside ?
I'm kind of a isolated person, with a couple good friends and some people I meet on irreagular bases, but all of us have their up and downs I guess.

All of the people around me accomplish things, you know, they get married, they move out from their parents, get a girl or a boyfriend, get laid, have a fulfilling job or school education, have the money to sustain a happy lifestyl etc.
They do something with their lifes and don't feel like complete shit 24 hours a day.

I've never got a real relationship in my life and I never expressed myself, who I truly am. I don't want to leave my tiny flat often here in Germany, so I listen to music and drink a lot of beer for several months now, so I get drunk once a week to escape. 

I'm just swimming under a sea of melancholy, dreaming to fade away into nothingness, but being scared somehow holds me  still here. 
I'm only 19 years old and I feel like I'm a 57 years old guy who had seen enaugh of everything. I'm so tired, Im tired of having no one who loves me, tired of being alone, I am tired of being fucking tired. I just wan't that this ends peacefully. I don't see any light, any sign of hope from my perspective, I'm going mental...

316859,"Did you lose friends after an attemptI made a suicide attempt recently (took sleeping pills) and thankfully I survived unharmed after a friend rushed me to the hospital where I spent a week. I am now recovering mentally and emotionally and I currently don’t have suicidal thoughts.

However, several of my closest friends have pulled away from me or turned against me.

The friend who took me to the hospital (who was my main source of support for the past year) has completely withdrawn and refuses to communicate with me (he says he doesn’t hate me and that we will remain friends in the future, but that he currently needs zero contact).

A few close friends who were informed of my attempt as I was still unconscious in the hospital formed a Facebook group chat to try to figure out where I was and how to help. As soon as they could, they all called me with loving and supporting messages. However, as I was still hospitalized, that group chat (who I was not in, but a friend sent me screenshots) turned into a conversation bashing me, saying I always had a shitty personality, that I was looking for attention, that I was doing emotional blackmail and manipulation, and that it was better to just ignore me. Two friends (including my BFF for 15 years) said the meanest things, and two friends remained completely silent in the group chat. One of those who remained silent said that she needed time before she could speak to me again.

This really shocked me and saddened me. These friends were my closest friends, they knew I suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts in the past and they had always been supportive. (For the record, we are all in our late 20s/early 30s).

Did any of you, attempt survivors, experience something like this? How do you explain it? How did you deal with it?

134297,"Modify the rule against witch-hunting. You see, you all are aware of what we've been seeing for the past few days in here. The girls who have been banned for denouncing harassers and all the reactions this have made.

People are calling for replacing the mod team (which I also agree with) after they literally locked a thread and banned a user who was denouncing literal harassment. I understand there's a rule against ""witch-hunting"", so I propose nothing but one thing: modify it. It's absurd people get banned and threads are locked for someone trying to help or asking for help. What they're doing (which is denouncing) shouldn't be banned anywhere, even more when we're talking about pedophilia in a community that it's for people, usually, under age of consent and a crime in many places. 

Witch-hunting, if that's an adequate way to call it in this context, will not only reassure the safety of the user in here, but might be useful for other Reddit communities to follow and ban this rotten behaviour. Mods, this is not something one should be against of. Modifying ONE rule for the greater good should never be a problem.

150630,"What happens if you don't have lemons?I don't really know what to say to myself anymore. My mind and my mood shift like the seasons - one moment I'm up, the next I'm mentally six feet under, commiserating my unfortunate life. It's hard to be positive and act like you're an exuberant ball of energy when your psyche walks a tightrope and one small nudge sends it into free fall. I have a frankly great job as a game developer, everyone tells me I'm so smart for completing a mathematics degree and I'm ""a good looking guy"" by a fair few standards. I see none of this. My mind has sculpted what is probably a much more accurate self-description; a self-obsessed slacker who gets by on his laurels and never works hard, someone who's barely anything more attractive than his skin colour and is a perennial failure.

Sounds harsh, right? Not really. That's my moderate estimation. I don't get given lemons from life, but I constantly cock it up enough that you'd think it does. I guess that's the problem with setting myself up in the ideal first. None of you actually know me, or will ever know me, that's probably why I'm so comfortable just letting my thoughts flow. They always stay bottled up, weighing my body down, deepening my speech, extending my feelings of dread. The voices which manifest aren't much fun either. Their stereophonic chatter just reinforces all the wrong I've done to myself, my friends and my family. The words of disgust I tell myself are all justified, mind you, as I've not lived a clean or wholesome life.

I've failed to live up to my own expectations. I've made unwarranted sexual advances in the past towards women, I've lied to friends and family and I never stood up for the people who stand up for me. My cowardice, loneliness and overall scum nature don't deserve a continued existence. No number of apologies, no attempts to change (no matter how many I've tried to make) and no platitudes will ever remedy these truths. My past will forever haunt me.

I was never given lemons. I have had, from humble beginnings, every opportunity to become a brilliant person, and I've failed to become that man. Mr. Successful stares at me in my sleep, with the girlfriend I've never had, the job security, the portfolio, the talent in sports which matches the time put in. He doesn't smirk smugly or contribute to the cacophonous sound in my mind - he just exists calmly in my periphery, doing what I fail to do. I am the stark contrast, and I constantly remind myself of this.

Is this my own form of torture? Probably. I'm too weak to provide a permanent fix. I'm so tired of my mind dragging me down when I try to become a better human being, a better developer, a better dancer or sportsman, but I don't confront it or silence it. I almost admire those who have taken their lives into their own hands because they had  the will to quieten that feeling of dread and discomfort. I keep thinking of my own funeral and that is a sad deterrent - my mum and I haven't been on good terms for years but the thought of seeing her cry over me is unbearable. It just leaves me stuck, in the eye of a storm I have no idea how to quell.

I wish I could say I tried to make lemonade, but what can I do when life never gave me lemons? ",depression

I'm unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something, or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery, or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn't waste or some shit like that.

Am worried; how seriously should I take it?My classmate ""J"" -- not quite a friend, more of a casual acquaintance  -- usually seems pretty happy and non-morbid. However, recently she often talks about wanting to end her life and being fed up with living, or (more rarely) discusses various suicide methods. A typical exchange goes like this:

&gt;J [completely out of the blue]: Oh man, Eruanne, I am so tired of life. I want to kill myself.
&gt;
&gt;Me [seriously]: J, don't joke about stuff like this. Really, don't. It's not funny at all.

I have someone who loves me and wants to spend his life with me.

I've written the final draft of my suicide note on my phone and I can't wait to transfer it on paper. 

No one i know is on reddit, so I guess it's safe here.

Mom, I love you. I ALWAYS have. I was never the child you wanted. I was your mistake you had to carry for 19 years. You'd always let me know how much I was a failure. By ending my life, you'll be freed from your misery. I love you. Now, you're finally free.

Dad, we never had the bond parents had with their children. Our relationship was almost cordial and formal. The only time I see you is passing you while heading to the bathroom. But I just want to let you know that I've always loved you. 

To my friends,
Thank you for being there for me. That you for spending time with me and making me feel like a real, functioning person. I love all of you. I'm going to miss singing and jamming with all of you. I'm going to miss going out, laughing and having a good time with all of you. Remember when we said we would meet up in like 10 or 20 years to see how we've grown? It's not going to happen with me around, but god bless that all the best happens to all of you. I'm sorry for doing this, but this is in the best interest, for the benefit of society, to have one less person who doesn't understand the social fabric of society. A person who brings the storm in the calm of a situation. No one wants to be that guy. It's sad really, but life goes on. We're all going to die and be forgotten, but it will not be in vain.

To my teachers, mentors and academic figures who have influenced my life,
With heartfelt thanks this is my word to all of you. Thank you for imparting the knowledge and thank you for helping me out in times of need. Thank you.

What I write may be the last time I ever....I almost wonder if 4chan would be better to write this on.  People cheering me on to end my life. 

I am ill with over exposure to mold. Add that to the health issues I had prior moving into this place in 2013. I am disabled and living here has pushed me. I asked the landlord if any water damage occured here prior to me moving in.  She said none.  I saw nothing odd and of course smelled fresh paint...nothing more or less.  After a week of being here,  I noticed water on the floor panels. Landlord had someone replace them and said I have no idea what that is about. The sliding glass door is broken and the home cannot be properly secured,  so rental insurance is not an option. This part will come in handy later. Over the 3 years of being here,  we have had at least 10 leaks that were fixed but mold left. At first my allergies just flared and I would sneeze or whatever. Now,  nowwww...after being told a new roof would be put on this place since February 2016, it has not happened. With all the rain,  we have leaks in our ceiling with black and green mold with a horrific smell that burns your nose and lungs.  I had to begin taking 3 24 hour Clariton a day and I never needed an inhaler prior to here.  Now I have to use one and none of this really works. I am itchy,  my hair is falling out,  I have found a lump in my breast,  one of our cats died of Cancer just out of the blue...he was healthy prior to. They want rent but will not fix anything. I have nowhere to go,  no friends or family to stay with and no help. I only get 733.00 a month and I don't know if you have seen lately,  but people are asking for 850.00 on a one bedroom in even the bad parts here. There are NO mold laws in this state and it just so happens where I live,  no health dpt either.  No one and I mean no one will help me.  I am already dying from living here,  it is obviously also making me severly depressed because I am sicker than ever and cannot live. My boyfriend is here too and we split expenses. He is an Army veteran,  was in the military 9 years and helped fight a greedy war all to get sh*t on,  because trust me...the VA is of no help unless you have outstanding credit.  He works 3rd shift EVERY SINGLE DAY. We need out of here ASAP but we cannot pay the rent here and have enough to get a new place...if we can even find one.  We have been bullied by the landlords and lied to for this long and I am going to die here. His health is suffering as well. I have had my normal blood work done,  as usual it just came back with high white blood cell count...yet they do not investigate. I have been through hell and back and you only know of what I am telling you now.  The rest is just too long and has nothing to do with poisonous mold,  but it took a toll on me mentally. There really seems no way out of this. Slowly die or take my life is where I am at.  It is going to rain more soon and it will just keep getting worse.  No one comes to even look at the damage...nothing!!!!!! I have pics but I can't capture the horrific smell. The owner of these rentals is notorious for not allowing maintenance to fix anything,  because he does not want to pay for it. He is a millionaire though,  so I am sure his air quality is excellent and he sleeps just fine at night. Well I am tired of it.  I am not living and as I type this,  and the ac is on blowing the smell around.  It is awful. With the hair loss,  which is a symptom of mold toxicity and No it is not my thyroid...had it checked,  I am embarrassed as hell. I wonder if I should just shave it now. I am disgusted.  The other day when it rained,  there was literally a waterfall going down our wall in the living room.  Outlets getting wet,  right next to all of our electronics and part of our couch.  Remember,  I told you we cannot get renters insurance because of the door they won't fix either.  They claimed they ordered it,  but 3 years it hasn't been fixed.  It leaks too. So not only is our health being taken,  our things are too. 

I am sorry for how long and stupid this is.  As I said,  I am alone on this.  I am stuck.  I am already dead.  Justice does not exist and since everyone is so racially bent out of shape here... I AM A WHITE FEMALE.  Race does not f****** matter,  this is health. &lt;-I was asked where I posted this before why I said it and all I can say is... Here, it seems as though you have to always specify. I've lived in other states and this one really takes the shit cake. Anyway,  I doubt I will stay alive for the fact that as I said before... I am dead already here.  I have two cats that I worry about too,  especially after the loss of the other.  This place is sickening and the injustice is the same.  So maybe this is my suicide letter.

i fit the roles expected of me that's all i can do anymore. i used to be able to tell myself it was for others, that no matter how bad of a person i am at least i was doing something under the pretense of helping somehow. i know now it's just selfishness.  i might have always known but never fully accepted it. i don't know. i don't know who i am or where the me begins from the survival mechanisms i either purposefully developed or have developed on their own.  ive lived under delusions my whole life. deep down more and more i've always been a parasitic coward and  even at a young age i pushed away people that cared for me. i didn't understand at the time what it meant or why i felt i  had to. i know now though. i knew there was something wrong with me at my core. i didn't want anyone to suffer 2nd hand trauma or whatever else due to how insidiously fucked up i was. around the only good people in my life then i could feel their disappointment, grief and also that they triggered past abuse memories and disortions all sitting there staring at me in the face and my own guilt for not being more brave during a certain time that most likely destroyed my friend. before the first time i tried to kill myself i did reach out. i did try to make them understand what was wrong,  and what was happening to me. it solved nothing but bringing me more pain, more guilt, more humiliation than i can describe.

my mother was an abusive alcoholic that mostly only knew how to scream at me, beat me shame me for every possible normal thing a human being is supposed to do  while ignoring me, leaving me alone for long periods of time.  chainsmoking and crying. my father killed himself. my whole rest of my family either ignored me or enabled my mother in every way possible. my sibling was just as abusive they were happy torturing me (molestation and rape was a daily occurnce for many years) physically, psychologically in any and all ways i can remember. he was forgiven for anything i was capable of telling about at various times because he was suffering the loss of my father, nothing about me mattered and was shown this.  they a long with my mother ganged up on me just to deny it all, he even had his friends to help abuse me (and no i'm not talking about namecalling insults or bullying even though of course there was plenty of that) . my mothers boyfriends mostly just ignored me all together usually unable to even spare a glance in my direction. despite this all i still loved them, i lied for them, i covered for them to my own detriment ( but now instead of seeing it as some altruistic sacrifice it was only out of fear). i didn't want them to suffer even though it should have been fairly obvious to anyone that was remotely in my life at all i think there were plenty of signs.  i was told repeatedly that if  i told anyone anything they, my mother would be put in jail that i would be sent to an orphanage and that i'd really know what it was like to experience true pain. my mother constantly told me horror stories of children that were made to live in these kinds of places. my sibling threatened worse abuse and enacted it when i fell out of line to what they wanted. the other people in my life were supremely religious and preached to me about how people are meant to suffer, forgiveness, to be grateful for what i have and so on. i didn't feel right exposing these things to them, i do not blame them in anyway whatsoever. the other people i cared for i did everything i could to seem ok and normal since i wanted more than anything to be accepted and loved by them, they were also affiliated with my family and for this reason i didn't feel safe here either.again i do not blame them only on myself for being a coward. so i learned how to pretend better. school was a different kind of punishment for me as i've always been stupid but i somehow mananged even there, for a while. the bruises, black eyes, speech problems,over sensitivity, emotional dysregulation, burns, scratches, crying about everything and anything whatever was easily diminished by my smiling idiotic face and friendly although irritating demeanor all came down to me just playing rough in their eyes i think. most of my peers wanted nothing to do with me and since i lack self awareness to a harsh degree i didn't and couldn't figure out why or how, it was like they knew there was something wrong with me.  i was laughed at, and mocked often but i guess not on a consistent enough rate to feel anything other than insecure really. it was there i guess i learned it was best to make a mockery out of myself before anyone could do it on their own. even when people arent laughing at me all i hear is laughter anyway so it for some reason made it easier to cope.  a bit later i devolved into not being able to do that so my brain decided developing one mental illness after another during this time and many suicide attempts.

i dont know or ever knew any of my motivations for doing anything. when i try really hard to think of what parts of me were good or anything decent about myself it must have come from a manicness of youth and delusions. at 16 i started not completely hiding who i was, what i felt, what i experienced and tried so  hard to escape from. i had friends, i cared about everything but everything seemed to just make me more traumatized and damaged the more immersed into whatever i could. i then dropped out of school completely, tried to kill myself a few more times, saved by friends. after spending the majority of this time in and out of hospitals, therapy and getting high every day i miraculously met someone that thought i had all the time in the world,tomorrow stopped seeming important.  that i'd just get better. that age didn't matter. i made damn sure they knew what i was and who i was but it didnt matter to them or even me, i felt love so i went back to the delusions to do everything i could to keep it, for me and for them. i thought i was getting better. i moved out, i worked multiple jobs. i supported myself my friends and even my partner. i gave everything i could until it wasnt enough. until i wasn't enough. i will not speak anymore ill of them as they didn't know any better either. i do not blame them. they are an amazing person and i always knew they were. even when i was being cheated on, i understood why.  i broke it off because i didnt deserve them. they pursued anyway. i wanted to be able to deserve them so i kept trying. i told them to leave me, so many times. to be with the person who they really wanted to be with who also really wanted them too. but they never fully did. later on we moved in together with our friends and by this point i was starting to break down and devolve. everyone got on each others nerves and there was constant arguing between everyone. nobody wanted to do their share, everything bothered me, having friends and people around me at all hours of the day and night drinking, the constant bombardment of smells, noises, new people and on and on started triggering me. my partner and i were arguing all the time as well. all my own friends had their own lives, were starting/going away to college, were partying themselves and or in serious relationships and working. i couldn't and cant drive (due to never pushing being taught then the few times i did try to  learn all i could do is shake from nerves and flinch realizing it was unsafe for me to drive anyway) and since all the money i  made while working went to living expenses it wasnt like i could even afford to save up for a car ( this is what i told myself for years, but i know now i should have tried much much harder to be independent) then wouldnt be able to afford i selfishly relied on my partner, as well as walked everywhere, took the bus to my shit dead end job. if my life isnt cliche, pathetic and shameful enough as it is i got pregnant at this time but didnt even realize it or know i was until i was almost 6 months. i thought i had stomach ulcers or something like that. i was so sick all of the time i could barely function. i had to quit my job or i most likely would have been fired since i was pretty much incapable of doing what was needed of me. i couldnt do what was needed of me as a roomate or a partner or a friend either. i didn't have insurance and couldn't afford going to a doctor and it was pretty much as if? if i was dying, so  be it. i didn't even consider the possibility of pregnancy until i started gaining weight in only the obvious place. my immediate thought was of course to get an abortion despite it being against everything i felt i blieved in. except..... it was way too late for that. adoption i considered and weighed it with my partner for it to come down with a very adamant and definite No, not allowed. i loved and wanted what my partner and his family wanted (and would want) even though i knew and always knew i never wanted to, or thought i was remotely capable of being a mother. it apparently didn't matter what i wanted anymore and honestly it never did. i didn't even know what the hell i wanted to begin with so again i can not blame anyone for the decisions i made (one of the many instances i was under the impression i was choosing altruism but instead it was just more fear and learned helplessness) and made alone. the pregnancy, the medical care and then the birth was traumatic, i was very ill and mentally sick, i was repulsed by myself more than i evevr had been in my whole life and going over in my head what i would be like as a parent. i felt ( and still do) guilt for what i knew i would already fail at.   not long after finding out i was pregnant and getting medical treatment i found out the gender and at the same time found out i was having twins. i'm glad i went through with it as fucked up as i am and always was they were and continue to be perfect in every way. they bring joy to everyone they meet, my partner, his parents and family who are some of the best people i ever met and have helped shape  them to be who they are. i am there and do everything for them to the best of my ability even though i know it can't and never will be enough.i thought i could live for them. i thought i could fake it for them, for my partner and my friends and lasted many years until the last few where i've completely lost control of maintaing any  dignity or sense of self i had left to keep going. i didn't know that adults that experienced abuse would be re-victimized by their own growing children. how every day of my life is a hell full of fear panic and pain  i can't escape how i desperately want to. how the most beautiful thing i ever done or will do in this life is tainted by me. how i literally have lost myself to others dreams and my own nightmares.

i pushed away everyone i was close to in some way or another due to paranoia over so many things, fear, not living up to the expectations expected of and demanded of me, and feeling like a burden and mistake to anyone i let into my life. at some point i began to actively self sabotage with what i now understand is narcissism, more learned helplessness and cowardice. i never physically cheated on my partner as i can't enjoy physical intimacy in any way as i just dissociate or berate myself mentally. i talked to people and took pictures of myself i don't know why i acted out in this way and the self hatred i feel is immeasurable i started burning myself ive tried thinking of all kinds of different reasons as to why but none of the reasons actually make sense because im brain damaged and i  don't have a soul. after i was confronted harshly by someone i hurt with my lies and in order to confront myself i told my partner what i did, because the amount of guilt i felt and created doing this only made everything  and my mental health worse as it ever had been and that would be obvious to any self respecting reasonable person, some part of me had hoped he would  abandon me so i could do what must be done. i stopped doing this and instead replaced it with a different way to fuck up by getting to know others, to befriend others under the deluded, selfish, narcissistic, co-dependent  belief to understand myself and for others to understand me.  i recently got some sense knocked back into me, have had a few episodes of psychosis trying to understand everything i told my partner what i have done again and offered to leave, instead i was taken to a hospital and released. i contacted a few womens and homeless shelters and put myself on waiting lists, but i don't deserve to be there either taking the spot of someone who needs it more than me.everything about me is wrong. my partner showed me mostly understanding and kindness despite everything and its just finally confirmed the only way for him to be free is to remove the parasite that's infected his and everyone ive ever cared abouts life. if i could be more sorry i would and i won't fail this time or anyone anymore.",depression

191229,"Feeling really suicidal lately (with reasons)I'm about 70% sure I want to do it. My reasons are:

My ex girlfriend. I fucked it up between us. I miss her immensely and am still in love with her. She is with another guy now, who she is in love with. I called her today next to the train tracks (I was going to jump). Sheis flying out tonight to go see him. I will be home alone while they will be fucking passionately. I can't deal with this situation.

My job. It's a dead end call centre job. I'm only working two more shifts but I will probably spend them thinking about my ex and him fucking.

My education. I've taken a gap year from university (I'm 20 years old), but I still have no clue what I want to do or how I'm going to cope without my ex there (she was my only real connection to Uni).

Depression. I've gone in and out of depressive bouts for about the past 6 years and I'm sick of it. There have been good times in life, but they're always thwarted by the shitty depressive episodes that last for months at a time.

96490,"Just wanna ventI've attempted suicide 2 times as of now. The first was when I was 13 I tried to hang myself. My parents found out and they did absolutely nothing. That summer I tried again, this time took 36 500mg paracetamol tablets. My parents didn't find out and it didn't work, just vomited them all up. Doing that made me realize how alone I am, I still haven't told my parents and I doubt they care that much TBH. I haven't told my friends and I don't really tell my friends anything, a lot of the time they call me ""kind of emotionless"" and shit like that. They have never seen me cry or open up to them despite them opening up to me. I breifly took a break from all the suicidal thoughts when I was in year 9 and 10. In the summer of year 10 I started having this crush on a girl, which made me realise how unattractive i am. Every day that summer I spent most of my time thinking about her and just how terrible I was. School stated and she didn't notice me. None of my crushes or any girls have every noticed me. Then I stated to get suicidal thoughts again and I stated to self harm. I now have scars all up my arm (not my wrist because at that point I didn't want to die, I just wanted someone to notice me). I'm pretty sure my best friend started to crush on the same girl but we never talked about it because ive never opened up to him and he's never opened up to me. I literally planned every day to get to talk to her for a few minutes. I now have a crush on this other girl who is a bit closer to me and we talk a bit. It's pretty clear to me that she doesn't like me that way even though I've never asked her explicitly. I'm worried about how the fuck I'm gonna live because if every time I like a girl I start to get suicidal I'm not gonna live very long coz I've been told life's only get worse. I was at a party a couple of days ago and she got into a depressed mood and I didn't know what I was meant to do cause I'm so socially inept. This other boy started talking to her (the guy is pretty much superior to me in every way: looks smartness etc). I feel like such a fucking failure. I just can't bring myself to tell anyone about any of my feelings hence why I'm here. I know how these next few month's are gonna go coz I start getting suicidal every time I crush. It's still the same. Nobody notices if I'm down and my friends still call me shit like ""emotionless"". Nobody comforts me or even gives me physical contact, not even my family. A fucking hug from anyone or something as simple as someone acknowledging that I'm sad could make me feel so much better but nothing ever happens. Anyway this year i got GCSEs and I'm gonna fail. After I fail I'm gonna be even more worthless and unnoticeable to everyone and I'm not gonna be able to get a job or do anything with my life, I'm literally gonna be alone forever. My sister is 2 years younger and better than me in every way. Ive stopped talking to her as much coz I'm so jealous of the attention she's getting from my parents. She goes to private school and is treated better than me in all ways. Nobody even takes me seriously and I can't talk to anyone and nobody's gonna believe anything anyway. I don't have any diagnosis of anything and my dad's a doctor anyway who's life has gone really well and he's worked really hard for the life he's living. I'm the opposite, I'm lazy, unmotivated and pretty unattractive not just in the physical sense but also through the fact that I just act cold to everyone. Everywhere I look people are better. I can't even fucking die without fucking up. I hope everday that this girl likes me but I know I'll be a shit boyfriend and deep down there's no way anyone likes me. If I was her I would never date me. I have no hobbies. I used to like playing games with my friends but at this point I can't even be bothered to do that. I certainly a not gonna revise for the GCSEs, I'm not motivated enough. Nothing makes me happy and the last time I was genuinely happy without any thoughts in the back of my head was a couple years ago. I spend hours every day alone crying in my room. I hate everything about myself and I know life's only gonna get harder when I have to get a job and im only ever gonna feel more alone when I'm 30 with no girl, no friends and all my family's dead. I get fantasies of getting mugged or hit by a car and dying or committing suicide and as my funeral happens everyone realises that I'm an actual human with actual feelings. Just writing this makes me realise how much better of a place the world would be without me and how people gonna mourn for a few days but then forget I ever existed. The difference a hug would make for me. Nobody notices me. Nobody even treats me like a human being anymore.

244885,"I'm a stone's throw away from giving up.I just can't do it anymore. Every god damned day gets harder and harder and harder.

I'm 21 years old, soon to be turning 22 in October and I feel like I have nothing that really binds me to this world.

Ever since I was 13 I've been depressed, although I wasn't officially diagnosed until I was 14. I remember when I was a kid all I ever wanted was someone to love me. I was awkward, shy and super introverted so I spent more time with my online friends than I ever did with anyone in School.

My dad used to buy my video games when I was still a pre-teen so I could pre-occupy myself while he did drugs, slept for 12 hours a day and then go to ""work"" as a Taxi driver, where in reality he would get in his cab, find a random street, park it there and then go back to sleep, but he'd claim he was at work.

My mom used to hit me when I was younger and because she was young (She was 18 when she had me) and had no one else other than me and my Dad, she used to vent her problems out to me because of course she couldn't to my Dad, and then eventually they divorced, both parents re-married and eventually, my Mom got full custody of me, which was the lesser of 2 evils between my parents. But I was the emotional rag that got yelled at, got hit at for everything minor until I was old enough to stop her from physically assaulting me. 

I remember when I was 14 years old, I'd stay up every night, hold my hands together so tightly it hurt and then prayed to a God. Any god, anyone or anything that was willing to listen to my prayers. I was so delusional to the point that I'd talk to a stuffed animal I had since I was a kid, or I would talk to the Characters on my One Piece poster because seeing that Poster made me think of so many things that I was hoping would come true in my life. ""I can't wait to have Friends like them some day in my life."" Is something I'd think about often. ""No one was born in this world to be alone."" was a quote that had a direct impact on me that I used to fully believe. 

I made up a lie that I convinced myself was true, telling myself that I was adopted and sooner or later my real Mom would come and take me home. Every god damned night I sat there, I prayed as hard as I could all while I had tears streaming down my face and I hoped and hoped and hoped that someone would eventually come take me away.

I watched anime, played video games and read books all so I could escape from reality and pretend I was someone else. Pretend I was somewhere else, where I was happy, where I wasn't so useless.

It's been 7 years since then. No one came to save me.
No one came to take me away. My ""real"" mom doesn't exist.
It's just me, by myself and I feel like even though I've outgrown my fantasies, I can't help but spend hours everyday day dreaming to the point where it feels like I'm addicted to it. I have to daydream to even function. I have to think about a life where I'm somewhere happier, and not in my current state.

By all means, my life isn't even that bad compared to a lot of people so that makes me feel even more guilty. Why am I even depressed?
I work a part time job in retail that I absolutely hate, but it gives me some money to spend on my escapes. 

My family is decently rich, they'll be paying for my College tuition when I start this Fall. Except I know I'm not going to live up to their expectations. I barely passed High School (Through LOTS of help from my Teachers when I got sent to a Learning Centre after I got expelled from Public School for skipping too much because I was too sad to even function in School.) but I lack so much discipline and motivation I can't even go get a haircut. It's been 6 months since my last one.

When I'm at work, even for my short 4 hour shifts, I think of all the different ways that I could painlessly die, whether by suicide or via an accident. The 9 hour shifts are especially bad because I already have a weak physical constitution. I just spiral lower and lower until I'm so drained emotionally and physically that when I get home all I can do is sleep. I'm so desensitized to the thought of suicide that I accidentally brought it up with a co-worker and had to laugh it off while back pedalling real hard.

I don't know, I'm just so tired of living. Every day Suiciding becomes more and more tempting, but I tell myself that I'd rather go see the world then Suicide rather than Suicide in this grief-stricken room of mine seeing the same thing everyday.
My memories become so bad that I can't even remember what I did a few days ago because all the days just blur together.
It feels like just yesterday I was 19 years old, but here I am almost 3 years later.

You know, it's pathetic, but my only escape from life lately has been coming home from work and playing some singleplayer games or watching anime, just like when I was a young teen. I just wish I could still find comfort in some imaginary person who I fully believe would eventually come ""save"" me, just like I did back then. I feel like I've just become cynical and jaded.

But at work, it's like I'm a completely different person. I have smiles on 24/7, I speak with a happy tone, I crack jokes and laugh, until I have to get away for a few minutes at a time because keeping up this fake, happy persona is just so tiring.
I really can't do it anymore. I'm at my wits end.

I'm sorry for the big wall of post. I'm not even sure if any of it's readable or comprehensible, I'm not exactly in the best state of mind. I can't wait to wake up in 3 hours for work and hate myself.
I just want to go to sleep and have an eternal dream that I never wake up from.
I'll even take going to sleep and just not waking up ever again so all this pain and misery could end. 

The only thing I'd miss is not being able to see the ending of One Piece and not being able to listen to Music that makes me feel like I'm in a different world if I close my eyes and imagine hard enough. I'd also miss one of my friends.
I've been so proud of him lately, he's an Artist that's been steadily improving over the years. It finally feels like he's starting to find a purpose in himself and his drawings, and he's finally getting the recognition he deserves. I'm so happy for him. I'm not a big impact in his life whatsoever, so even if I were to disappear I don't think it'd make a difference. 

If anyone read this far, Thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to some kid on the internet vent about his problems. I have a quote to share with you all that I've held dear to my heart for years and years now.

""People commit suicide because they think they have no other choice, not because they want to die.
Every single human being would rather be happy than dead.
In the end, no one ever really wants to die.""

And very few want to help me. I feel alone. Always. Even around other people. I have been treated before. I was meh ok for a while.  But now I realize that the rest of my life will not be pleasant. I want to end it. I am currently writing letters for certain people to read so that they can feel less sad and perhaps even better themselves.  Im sorry but this is the way I am.choosing to go. I would have rather gotton some opiates and OD on a good dose, but that is not today.

49845,"I’m too scared to end it.I turned 18 this year and it has been the worst year of my life. Before I start this I just wanna point out that in my friend group I’m the strong one. You know guys aren’t supposed to get sad or depressed. You just keep moving. I don’t tell anyone about my problems but I think it’s time I open up to someone even if it is just people on the internet. 
I’ve been contemplating suicide since May this year. Every day I wake up I just wonder what death is like and how bad I just want it all to end but I’m just too scared to end it. I went to jail in May, right after my dad said that it would be best if I moved in with my mom. Moving to a completely new state Where I don’t know anyone and all I do is work and go home at night. I know you’re gonna say “well try to make friends” I’ve tried. I’ve met new people and tried to go out more but people just get tired of me.
Now I’m back with my dad until my probation is over but all he does is call me worthless. Him and my mom both wanted me to go to the military. I understand why I mean a place to stay and free food away from my family and with all the benefits it’s a no brainer but I guess I’m stupid. Music is my passion. Everyday I make new music and learn new things but my dad says all I do is take up space, I’m literally nothing. And I feel like nothing. I mean thanks for pointing out the obvious of how worthless and stupid I am and how I don’t do anything but eat his food and use his electricity and live in his house but I can’t do anything. I can’t get a job because I’m only gonna be here for a couple months. I don’t even know anymore I just wanna make him proud of me but all he sees me as is a failure. I mean I have to love him he’s my dad, he might not have been around all my life but he’s my father and I just wanna make him proud. If I can’t do that I think I’d rather die. I know it’s my life and I do what makes me happy but the only thing that would make me happy is the support of my dad. I just wanna be better but every little thing I do sets him off. I just feel like I wouldn’t be a bother if I just ended everything, it’d make his life so much easier ",depression

So for my first time, I joined, they introduced us and everything. Things were nice. A bunch of people joined, one named ""Nicki Minaj"" and ""Anya"". So we were talking about a website development competition and half way into the slideshow this girl, Anya, says ""So what happens if you are from another school?"" which felt really out of place and odd. The teachers didn't understand and wanted to elaborate and she said ""Well, uh, I'm not from this school."". This was tech club for only my school so that was weird. We asked her where she was from and she's like ""Uhh yeah, I'm from Tennaseee"". That was extremely weird. We're in Oregon so that was extremely far away. We asked her how she got here and she told me her that her friends told her about it in a chatroom. We asked her what kind of chatroom and she then said, ""This guy on Omegle spammed the zoom link so I'm like sure whatever"". The teacher asked ""What's an Omegle?"" and the student helping them started sighing and he's like ""Ohhh man Omegle is a place filled with creeps and predators and uh..."", then when we were piecing things together the person named Nicki Minaj just says out of nowhere ""YOU BITCHES DIDN'T LET ME FINI-"" and spammed music before getting kicked.

I seriously don’t give a fuck anymore. I’m 24 and I’ve spent my whole life forcing myself to do shit to be happy and it’s always the same. Friends go and they don’t care to see you anymore. Force myself to take up new things hoping I’ll find an answer. Push the limits of my comfort zone hoping to meet new people but it’s all the same fleeting bull shit, no genuine lasting connections.

Death seems like the best option. My dad says I need to be strong and selfless and stick around for my family but I don’t care. I don’t want to live on feeling like shit. I am 24 and I have tried so fucking hard and I always get shit on. 

All I wanted was to find somebody who loves and understands me and the older I get the more I realize that’s all bull shit. I try. I try really fucking hard. But it never works out and after countless attempts I know in my soul it never will and if I don’t kill my self I’ll end up being alone.

207721,"I'm trying my best to keep going but I'm done.I'm 24 but I can't take it anymore. My over critical dad constantly on my back and my mom being overcritical too but she's less on my back, getting tired of where I live and I just think I'll try to get it over with by this week. Don't know when. I know a bridge in my area where I can get it over with.

I work 2 shit jobs (1 seasonal) in pursuit of a Finance degree but I can't even take school anymore. It's unbearable and I don't even want to do the next semester.

I've faced my problems for too long (half my life) with little to no tangible results, ridicule, have had constant suicidal thoughts/attempts for 4 years now and a few in high school but not as much as now. I kept quiet, did what I had to do with finesse and i was efficient in almost all aspects of my life but I now think I'm at the point of burnout (been 2 weeks now). I can't deal with life anymore. I'm done. Finished. 

For context and I know it sounds stupid but some chick earlier this afternoon (a little older than me or I think around my age) was with her mom and her little kids. At my shit job, I started saying hi smiling and she smiled back but murmured and had a little mocking grin facing her mom. I felt a little out of my element and was less energetic and I started feeling a little gloomy. The chick then left the store running and laughing with her mom. I had this happen to me with two chicks who I gave Halloween candy to back in the 11th grade and they just looked at me and started running off and laughing. The fucked up part is that she's not an ugly chick. She's actually decent looking.

This is the shit I have to live through. I just came back from my shit seasonal job at Amazon and got to the other store (my other job) right after that. I was actually feeling OK but then I thought about all of the shit I had to endure for the whole waking up at fucking 5:45 am to get to my first shit job of the day. Fuck that.

The reason why this is fucking with me is because a few chicks used to make fun of me back in high school and it still continues to this day. What's the point of living if every single move is in anticipation of being ridiculed and mocked. Then people who live in their own bubbles (like my manager ) who I'm cool with tell me to get over it even though I listen to all his girl problems he has on Tinder and try to offer solutions and listen to him. I don't get shit on Tinder so yeah, I can't relate bro.

I'm just tired in general. Just tired of constantly being reminded of my ""responsibilities"" from my dad and just tired of the BS from everyone. The best part is I have no one (except a former mentor) of mine in high school to talk to about this shit I'm dealing with and I haven't spoken to him in 5 years. My friends which I have none at the moment because I text them and they don't want anything to do with me judging by their non replies.

 And I will not tell my parents my suicidal attempts/thoughts. They won't understand. Plus being a black man fucking makes this shit all that more great.

I'm done with a passion and I think I'm at the point of no return. I'm a 5 minute walk away from an interstate overpass so I'm good to go. Fuck life.

I'll probably have to go to my shit Amazon job tomorrow and then rinse and repeat until I go through with my plan around this week. I've tried everything except for full fledged therapy and taking a vacation or leaving my area for a few days. I've tried positive thinking, exercising. But it all seems for naught since I'll be faced with another setback as I'm always faced with. It's like everything good I do ends up turning to shit. What's the point.

230479,"My “friends” bring me to suicidal thoughtsI just want to start out by saying I’m a college student who moved here with a couple friends. I do not work and go to school full time while all my friends work and go to school part time. Since I do not have a job my parents will help financially if need be. I’ve battled with suicidal thoughts but my friends make them worse.

Ok, it all started when my first semester in college when my friends would joke about me being “daddy &amp; mommy’s money.” This didn’t bother me at first and I would joke back with them and we’d all have a good time. But, it got worse they began doing it when around other groups of friends and posting about it on social media making me feel like I’m worthless. The insult began to get worse ranging from “bum” to “broke bitch” and now they use it as a crutch to impress other people. These words and actions run through my head at night and make me think “am I really worth living?” Or “maybe my family will have more money without me.” The only thing that has helped me was my dog who has been by my side for the past 6 years but now he lives with my dad and the thoughts have been coming on strong recently and more frequently. One of the biggest blows was when I was with a girl and my friend and we all decided to go out to the bars for the night. While we were all hanging out they decided to start telling her various things about me and tell her how broke I am and how I wouldn’t be able to get her drink but they could.

All this makes me feel like they’d be a lot happier without me and life would be better for them. I always get to the point of ending it but get to scared. but here recently it’s beginning to feel like I won’t back down and actually go through with it. ",depression

250921,"might as well just end it nowidk what is wrong with me but i’m fucking destined to be alone. it has to be my fault somehow :(

nobody has ever liked me back or wanted to start a relationship with me in any way. this has affected my self esteem so insanely much, loneliness is literally the root of all my problems: i get worried there’s something people just intuitively hate about me, so i over analyze my physical appearance every chance i get. i worry too much about what i eat and how much i eat so i can have a nice body and so maybe just maybe someone would think i’m attractive enough to look at. nights crying about not being able to afford plastic surgery to fix what i see wrong with my face, because maybe it’s my face, not my body that pushes people away.

i have never been catcalled or flirted with by a man, and while i’m grateful that i have never had to deal with this or deal with harassment, it fucking makes me feel so unwanted and unloved that not even some dude on the street thinks i’m pretty. i just want somebody to think i’m pretty. the worst part is i genuinely think i am a physically attractive person. but obviously there’s something i can’t see about myself that is so vile and repulsive that nobody has ever tried to start anything with me my entire life.

loneliness has put me through the worst depressions of my life. it sucks feeling like you have absolutely nobody that cares about you, but it sucks even more knowing that it’s completely true. it’s not even just relationships, i have never had a longterm group of friends, and i have dealt with multiple “rejections” from friends who just cut me off and decided they didn’t like me anymore. back in high school when i couldn’t drive i spent every lunch period alone for two years. i felt so fucking pathetic every day. nobody fucking cared. i don’t know what the fuck i’m doing wrong. it’s so hard to live like this. if this is the way my whole life is going to be i might as well just end it now. i try so hard to be a loving and kind and funny person, and people have told me that i am those things, so why am i so alone always always always always

one time this girl told me i was smart for not dating anybody all throughout school. i laughed in the moment but that comment hurt so damn much. if i had the opportunity?? i would be dating left and right. i crave so much physical affection that i have never received. i cried again that day because it reminded me of how nobody wants me. i have spent hours in my bed sobbing about loneliness. life is too much for me to handle on my own. i feel like i have zero emotional outlets, and who would want to hear me cry about how i feel alone anyways. they don’t understand that i have genuinely felt this way my entire life. it hurts so bad. it’s not that i haven’t tried making the first move either. i talk to people, flirt with people, try to make new friends, but it is never reciprocated.

back in fall of last year, there actually was one guy who started to flirt with me. the problem was that he didn’t actually like me at all. he has tried to get with every fucking girl near him, so while he was “flirting” with me, he was also flirting with girl 1, girl 2, girl 3, girl 4, etc at the exact same time. but of course i fucking fell in love with him at the first sign of affection because i thought i was somehow special.

he hurt me so fucking bad. i was not special at all. he was the first person in my entire life to show ANY kind of attraction to me but it wasn’t real. at all. i genuinely think this is going to ruin all of my future chances at a relationship. i can’t fathom anyone feeling attracted to me at all. if they are, it’s a fucking sick joke on me. i am completely and utterly alone. the same amount of alone as i was before this guy came and ruined any progress i was making on my self esteem. not exaggerating when i say i cried for 4 months straight after this happened.

the horrible thing is that he gets away with it. because every girl starts to get feelings for him because he gives them attention, and because he’s an attractive person. they think they’re special!! just like i did!! once the girls realize he’s a horrible person he cuts them off and moves on to the next girl. he’s already dating someone new that i KNOW feels the exact same way i thought i did. but he is not genuine. she is going to get hurt the same way i did. i want to scream and cry so hard. 

the only reason i care so much about what he does is because i still have feelings for him. i know he’s a horrible person, i know he doesn’t like me, i know he would be a bad partner, i know he would probably cheat on me once he found another girl, but my stupid fucking brain won’t let go of the little bit of attention he gave me 8 months ago. i still have feelings for him. because i’m so fucking alone. i fantasize about being in a relationship with him to help me feel less alone. but it only ever makes me feel worse. how can i be so unlovable that someone would just use me as a toy to flirt with so he can get other girls. i’m worried i’ll never get over him. which is horrible to think about because we were never a thing in the first place. 

i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t want to keep living like this. i’ve read every article on what to do if you feel alone, but i’m sick of taking myself on dates and trying to meet new people and driving by myself for hours and hours just to distract myself and cry more.

i started a new job recently and i have no idea what i’m doing, it’s just a minimum wage retail job but thinking about going there makes me want to vomit from anxiety . i feel as though every person in the building despises me. i feel so completely alone in this world. i want everything to end. i have no one. i never will. i don’t feel like i deserve this. it’s getting so hard and i don’t know how much more i can take. but i would probably wait until i’m out of school, so nobody has to make an announcement to the school saying i fucking killed myself. how pathetic would that be. how selfish would that be. i want to do it so badly but i know i never will. i know it would hurt people.

They have me seeing a psychiatrist, and started me on meds, however it feels like after every step forward there are several giant leaps back.

It also hurts not being able to do a lot of the things I enjoyed, as soon as I get near a group of people I am fighting off a panic attack.

I have thoughts several times per day of killing myself just to make it go away.  I feel like this anxiety willbnevrr go away, maybe ending it would finally bring some peace back into my life, or at the very least bring an end of feeling scared all the time.

So obviously I'm not wanting to kill myself right at this very second. But for the past few years it's been on and off pretty consistently. I don't know how many times the 'three day rule' saved me. 


The first time I ever really wanted to do it, I wanted to get off a bus to jump off a tall structure nearby. I was 17. But I didn't. I was reading a book on the bus and even though I didn't care about anything, I kinda cared about how the book ended. A few months later, I was hiding in a public garden near there, making out with someone I'd recently met, and I looked at that tall structure for a moment and thought ""I'm glad I didn't do that; this is pretty great."" 


The next serious moment was over a year after that. It was a couple days after I opened pandora's box and realized I am transgender. I've never been transphobic, but the revelation was too much for me on top of everything else. I can't talk about it. I had one foot in the land of the dead.  


There were a few bleak moments in the couple years after that. Actually a few months ago, I was on the subway headed wherever. Plan was to get smashed and then maybe do some more hard thinking about if it was all worth it. But this crackhead sat down next to me and started telling me why the English language is the devil (fair enough really, but I didn't want to hear about it). I wanted to get away from him, so I got off at the next stop. And a few minutes later, I ran into a buddy and ended up just shooting the shit with her over coffee for a couple hours. And later I thought, damn- that crackhead on the train really did me a solid. What were the odds of me getting off the train at the exact right time, at the right stop, to run into one of the few people I would have been willing to interact with? I live in a large city. I don't believe in god or fate or anything- but if I did, I'd think someone upstairs sent ""English is the devil"" guy my way. 


And today I feel completely drained. You know the drill. Nothing seems worth it. I don't care about anything, except for a few people. The best thing is to not forget about them; depression can make you forget. But hey, writing this thing energized me enough to walk to the fridge. So there's a bit more life in me than there was 10 minutes ago. I wish I had some tranqs, but then again I don't know if I could get more sedated than I already am. 


I don't want to go into specifics, in case someone I know sees this. But I'd have to say the main cause of my depression is that I'm so uncomfortable with myself, mostly due to being closet trans but also due to other things. Then there's also external factors, like people being stupid and the future seeming really bleak. But fuck, I'm so far down the hole. I don't remember what it's like to not be depressed. I'm not even sure if I want to be not depressed. If I wasn't depressed, I'd care more about stuff. Fuck that. How would I get by at all if I cared more? 


I'm a bit drunk now so one more story. Like two weeks after that time I didn't want to talk about, I called someone I trust and told her about it. She said she wanted to call the cops. I didn't want her to do that, and plus I had work, so I told her that if she didn't, I'd call a crisis hotline and tell them everything, and if they told me to go to the hospital, I would. And I guess I could've just lied, but I was good to my word and called them. They told me they didn't think I was a danger to myself anymore, so I called the person I'd told and reported back to her. She believed that I'd called them- maybe not the best thing to do, but since I really had, it worked out. Her memories of that summer are totally fucked, so I don't know if she remembers any of it now. Part of me wants to ask. 


I have to get out of bed now. I can see my tits and my big lady hips from the position I'm lying in, and I care just enough to not want to look at that. Which is more than I cared about anything twenty minutes ago- so maybe there's hope for me yet. ",depression

I couldn't even hang out with friends without getting headaches and neck pain. In the last week, it was the first time I actually felt like I was getting better. So much so, I decided to go pick nicking with friends today. When I arrived at the park, I go struck in the head by a frisbee. As dumb as it seems, the impact made me lose consciousness and when I finally got back from my apartment, all my concussion symptoms are back. It just seems that every time it starts getting better, everything just goes back to shit. I don't feel like I have any strength left to go trough recovery once again.

318541,"So I planned my death todayI am a transgender Police Officer. 8 months ago my wife of 7 years discovered I was a closeted trans woman. This led to a break up 3 weeks later. She wasnt happy that I had lied and said she would have been fine with it if she knew from day 1. She gave her terms for us staying together and said she would help me to buy clothes if I remained closeted. She set out alot of rules I couldnt meet however I believed she would come around as she was somewhat supportive and has LGBT+ friends. 
I have felt strong feeling of suicide on several occasions and was stopped by the fact I didnt want to be without my son and I didnt want my colleagues to have to deal with the literal mess my body would make.
Xmas day was hard not being with my family. I got very drunk and made some bad choices.

I feel constant rejection and pain. Unending pain.

Anyway... today my son tells me today that mummy and daddy are at home. I am very confused and text the wife what that was about. She explained that yes she had met someone and through conversation I find out there is 100% no chance for us. 
I have always believed marry once, marry for life and you work things out. 
I dont blame her at all for us separating and I actually am glad she has met someone who will hopefully look after her as I wasnt a great husband. I think that has helped with my decision as she has someone who will love her, she is amazing and easy to love, and he will support her if my passing causes any problems but sounds like it wont as she moved on. Also, my son is so young he wont remember me so he wont be upset or be caused any trauma. 

Im side tracking myself... like the title says, its all planned. I have chosen my outfit, made sure I have ID with me so I can be ID'd if its not my team working. Its not too messy I hope so wont be too horrific. Only thing stopping me is I want it to look like an accident so all 3 of my life insurance policies pay out. Only 1 covers suicide but I want to leave goodbye messages, especially to my son. Have an essay for him and a couple of letters for other people. And if they dont pay out my wife will be homeless. 

Once that is all worked out, probably through some postal thing so it wont be delivered for 5 months if I can arrange that, I shall be at the end of my long and painful journey. 
I have never know what it is like to live a day without some level of pain. I thought coming out would change that. All it did was change where the pain came from

I often feel like just ending it all. Its just no point in anything anymore. I get bullied in school so much. It\`s every single day no matter where I go it's always there, even online. I\`ve deleted my Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Simply because I was getting so much harassment. And if that sounded bad. We haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. The f\*cking school hallways. It's a hell on earth, I get shouted at, pushed, grabbed, teased, even hit. They call me ""s\*ut"" ""wh\*re"" ""bi\*ch"" ""ugly"" ""fat"" ""disgusting"" and much more. Really everything you could think of. I\`m scared to go to school because I don't know whats going to happen.

Sometimes I go to the library to try and relax a little during lunch breaks. They once ripped my phone out of my hand and said that they were going to smash it. They didn't, but still.

Back when I was 13, I had just switched schools because of bullying. I was trying to start a new life. Everything was going fine. I was dating one of the boys. We were together for about a month until it all went to shit and it has been there to haunt me ever since. I'm 14, almost 15 now. That dickhead guy is now together with one of the other girls. I think that relationship is what really started the firestorm. I

it's usually a group of 3 girls and 2 guys. Everyone can see everything that is happening and they don't do anything. It makes me feel so helpless. They will take any opportunity to take what I say out of context and turn it against me. They will fabricate false stories and spread fake rumors just to make me look bad. They say that I\`m really close to my brother, like REALLY close. Wich, I am not. I love my brother, as a f\*cking brother. And that I have a crush on this one 17-year-old guy, who I bearly even know. I don't understand why they do this to me, I'm not a mean person in any way, actually I'm probably one of the nicest people you'd meet.

There is absolutely no fun in anything anymore. Everything is just an endless struggle. There is no escape from it. I am legally forced to go to school and I cant do anything about it. People think there is so much getting done to prevent it and yes there is a large amount of anti-bullying campaigns, but all they do is make people more aware of the issue, the bullies don't give a sh\*t and they are the once who are the real problem. My parents don't understand and the teachers just overlook it. When I get home from school, I just go to sleep immediately because all I do is cry. Sleeping is the only sort of escape I have. I have switched schools once and there are no other high schools in my area. I'm never going back to that school.

I've never really liked who I was as a person, I'm fat, ugly, untalented, socially awkward, incapable of getting a girlfriend...the list just goes on. I tend to stick to hobbies/things that I feel like I'm good at, but I tend to shift away from them after not too long cuz I just realize that I'm completely shit at everything. I just can't do anything right. The only thing I'm good at is school at this point, and I'm losing passion for the very major that made me go to school. I'm in a great school (top 10 in the world for my field of engineering) and have a good gpa, but I feel like I've given up everything to get there. And I'm realizing that I'm really not that smart...i'm just good at school. And not only that, but being the socially awkward fuck that I am, I can't really get back into being social. I'm a horrible mess, and I hate being me.

This past year has been rough because I lost my best friend. Long story short, I ruined the friendship, and she's moved on.

259576,"I’m a ticking time bombThrowaway account. I wrote this to pour out my sadness. I feel so alone while I’m surrounded by people that love me. I’m so broken. 


I feel so lonely, not because I’m alone in this particular moment. I feel alone, in this world. Misunderstood. Forgotten. 

I have two close friends, maybe just one. He recently got into a relationship and I’m happy but I’m sad. I’m sad because all of his attention will be hers. He won’t be available to hang out with me. He doesn’t reach out as often as he did. He leaves me on read for hours even days. 

I think of dying probably more times than I actually think of surviving life. I think of dying while I’m cuddling with my boyfriend late at night. I think of dying when I’m having a good time with friends. I think of dying while I laugh so hard I start crying. I think of dying. 

I feel like that’s my only way to actually be happy. I love my boyfriend. I love him more than life itself. More than my life. 

I fantasize about killing myself. How would I do it? Would it be effective? Will i survive and live with the guilt and have everybody around me know how broken and fragile I can be and keep a close eye on me that I cannot breath? Will I kill myself after a bad long day at work? After I take my kids to school? After a wonderful date night with my husband?

I’m broken and sad. I don’t know what to do. I walk around with all these suppressed feelings so I don’t make my mom sad. I have these thoughts in the back of my head as I force myself to get up and go to work every cold morning. I feel this pain in my chest that just keeps growing like a stubborn weed pushing itself through concrete. 

I want to be happy, I don’t like being sad. I can’t help it. 

I think of all the people that will die. I think of all my close friends and family members dying one day. Having to bury every single one and not being able to take it. Every death chisels a piece of my broken wall. Tearing it down piece by piece until I disappear and become an empty shell. 

I need help

I can’t get help because only crazy people get help and I’m not crazy. I don’t need someone to tell me how to live my life or what to think. I pave my own path but I don’t know how to pave. I don’t know how to paint a pretty picture or how to craft.

124778,"Apathy for life and deathHello there, I'll start off by saying that I don't feel like living anymore, I really want to have a will to live, but for a while now I haven't had a real reason to live.

It wasn't this way, but about four years ago I lost my best friend and I couldn't find any reason to even smile, yet I wasn't allowed to mourn because people looked at me as the one who had to remain strong so that it didn't all come crashing down, or at least it felt that way. Now I don't feels depressed for this, it was 4 years ago and I've come to accept what happened, I have no regrets about it, I said he told me everything we had to and wanted to while he was alive, so there were no words unsaid.

This however brings another problem, while going to grief I had a reason to live, or at least it felt that way, I wasn't living for me anymore, I now had to live life for me and for him, because he loved life, but after I came to accept his passing it slowly became dull, Life no longer felt like life.

I do have friends whom I love and my family is great, I don't have bad grades or suffer from bullying, it's just that living is no longer appealing to me, my friends and family are clever enough to stop me from killing myself, they know me very well, so killing myself is not something that I try often, however I do wish I could just up and die, I don't fear death, I embrace the idea of me dying, I wish my bus would drive off the cliff, or for a Stray bullet to hit me in the back of the head.

Even if I did managed to move and settle down in Canada, have a better life, etc, I don't know if that life is worth living if I don't feel like I have any purpose. Maybe my problem is mild compared to others, I just forgot how horrible it is to be depressed and suicidal again.",depression

290454,"Life shouldn't have to be this way.I recently moved in with a friend of mine after my parents kicked me out for doing poorly in college. It was awesome at first, because I was finally able to feel independent and in-control for the first time.

After the first week though, things started to go downhill. My roommate invites over his obnoxious friends every night. When I tell them to leave or to be quiet while I sleep, they call me an unreasonable asshole. Now I'm *THAT* roommate. The killjoy. The party pooper. The wet blanket.

The more I try to get them to stop, the more they insist that *I'm* the crazy one. I end up losing hours of sleep, and then I have to get up early for work in the morning. 

Now that I'm a full-time employee at the hardware store, I have no flexibility with my schedule. Sure, I get a more decent paycheck. But it's nothing compared to the paycheck I could be getting if I had just forced myself through school and got a degree. 

Now I have to live with people I don't like, work with people I don't like, and try to squeeze out any slight trickle of enjoyment from the rare moments that I get any time to myself. 

It's like I've hit a dead-end. It's going to be this way for at least a year. The lease doesn't expire until then, and I have to stay full-time if I want to pay the rent, which is fairly expensive.

I try to drown everything out by listening to music on my headphones at night, but it's just not enough anymore. No matter how many times I temporarily escape for a few hours, I will always wake up to many more hours of agonizing stress the next day. Kill me now. I can't stand to go another day like this.

132220,"8 years of severe depressionI've had severe depression for 8 years of my life like the type that you think about suicide multiple times everyday. It started in 6th grade with a girl I liked (of course). I've always thought of myself as an unattractive untalented stupid skinny guy with no purpose in life. I was very depressed about this girl not liking me back but I always thought something like ""oh I'm better than this, I shouldn't be this depressed, Ill just ignore it"". So I would talk to a lot of people who were often involved in the popular group but I always felt out of place and like I wasn't friends with any of them and they were just pitying me. I was in math class (which was one of the only classes I enjoyed going to because of the teacher and the few people who were actually nice to me) but one of the girls next to me eventually said ""you are so annoying just shut up"" so I took that as constructive criticism and I just stop talking and turned into a very quiet kid. My home life wasn't the best either, my parents hated each other and would fight all the time until they decided to get a divorce when I was 5, but they went on Dr. Phil to get a divorce. When I get really depressed I like to be completely alone and I often dream of being one of those completely secluded hermits that live in places so far away from other people as a way of gaining inner happiness, but then I realize I live in the real world and I would have to work a lot or get a really good job that pays a lot and eventually quit when I got enough money. But my parents never understood my need to be alone, so we would always be pushed apart making my home life even worse. Then I made a plan to workout and get muscular so I could have a better chance of being liked and more attractive. I've been working out for 5 years and I am very physically small at 5'7"" and 135 lbs, I am very toned but you wouldn't know unless you were looking at me shirtless (I even tried supplements and other things to help but I could never gain any weight). After I gained a little muscle I did notice that I was getting more popular and were talking to a lot of people but they were all guys and never any girls, I did try to talk to them but I always got the feeling they didn't like me at all and were just trying to get out of conversations. People have told me that I'm alright looking then a lot of people say that I'm ""fugly"" so I always assumed that I was ugly and people don't want to talk to me or treat me less because of it even when I'm really nice and friendly. In senior year of high school I took choir because I needed an art credit and I had a very deep voice, halfway through the semester we were getting ready for a concert and I was miserable (I hated choir and just wanted to get out), but then all of a sudden a girl hit me with a water bottle and started talking to me trying to cheer me up. This girl was alright looking and skinny but I wasn't attracted to her. Then next few days she kept talking to me and eventually asked me to ask her to the homecoming dance so I did. She then asked me to be her boyfriend and I said yes, I had never had anyone that even appeared to be interested in me. Then after a week or two she kept telling me how many guys she has been with and how she ""loves dick"", I thought that she was saying all of that because she really wanted to have sex with me and after we did she never stopped. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and 4 weeks into the relationship I broke up with her and she seemed like she didn't even care. Then after a day I realized just how much I missed having someone to talk to and always looking down at my phone to see a text. Three days after I broke it off she went up to my best friend with a piece of paper that had her number on it and they started texting a lot. I thought that I had made one of the biggest mistakes of my life when I broke up with her so I fell madly in love with her trying to get her back but she just said that I was manipulative when I told her that I was mad about her going after my best friend. That eventually ruined my relationship with my best friend, that group of friends, the girl, and my parents (who didn't understand that I wanted to be alone). That girl eventually did nearly an identical thing to that friend. It pained me to see that girl in the hall everyday often with several guys. At this point I was the most depressed I had ever been. A few months go by (everyday of which were hard for me to do anything) but there was a choice I had to make about my future, which college to go to. I wanted to go to a community college for a year or two and work at the same time then enlist in the marine corps after those years. But my dad had a different idea, so instead of him respecting my decision to go to community college he decided to apply to a university for me. I was excepted and he paid a few things so I would feel obligated to go which I did. College made me very depressed, I got a really weird roommate who was very creepy so after having to wait two months I finally got switched to a different room, but this roommate would never leave and would never talk to me (I later found out that he had aspergers). So in other words I was so lonely with no friends. I even tried to talk to several girls that I was interested in, but all of them treated me like shit. I didn't really try in college so I mainly got several Cs but I got one F in my hardest class. My dad found this out during winter break right after I got into a huge argument with my sister, so I told him to return all of my Christmas gifts that he had bought me and that I would be living in my dorm the rest of winter break. Christmas is today and I'm still at my dorm getting messages that I am a really shitty child from my Grandma, Sister, Stepsisters, Step mom, and my Father. All I do anymore is just watch movies sleep, sleep, and occasionally work, this is all because I no longer find anything fun or worth my time. I would go get help from a professional, but that would severely ruin my chances of getting into the marine corps, so I came here to reddit to get a few opinions about what I should do and how to even live.",depression

Monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.) and looked better than the one I was going to get. This monitor was an ASUS VG248QE. It looked nice, was 27”, and 144 hz. We decided to buy it, and asked an employee if it was in stock. It wasn’t. That sucked, but we looked around the store some more, and I found the exact keyboard and mouse that I was going to order on amazon (red dragon). I bought those. Later that day, we went to Best Buy to return some earbuds that my dad didn’t like, and while we were there we decided to look for a mouse pad. Surprisingly there wasn’t one, so I looked online later that night. I found one for $10, and sent the link to my dad. He said that we could only pick it up at a Best but in cherry hill (I live in philly) but we decided to get it because it’s not that long of a drive. While we were at the best buy in cherry hill, we decided to look for the monitor we ordered and just cancel the order if they had it here. They had the monitor on display, but non in stock. We got the mouse pad and went in the car. We looked up on Best Buy’s website to see if there were any stores that had the monitor (since I wouldn’t get the monitor till Thursday). There was an open box monitor that was in excellent condition in mays landing, which is a 45 minute drive from cherry hill. That took us a while to get to, but we got there. When we picked up the monitor, my dad asked the guy helping us why he couldn’t cancel the order. The guy gave some bullshit reason which was even though it wasn’t shipped out of the wear house yet, it was in a delivery box and marked as shipped. I don’t blame the guy working there, I just think it’s stupid, but I digress. The guy said that we could return the monitor as soon as it came in for a full refund. During the car ride home, I came up with a great idea. When the new monitor comes, I’ll swap out the new monitor  wit the open box one, and give the open box one to Best Buy in the box of the new one and keep the new one. I told my dad and he approved, so on Thursday I get a new monitor without having to wait to use my pc.",non-depression

As the lockdown of fall 2020 intensifies, you'll see more and more people lose thier jobs and become unemployed, and eventually homeless. This isn't accidental, this was planned. I can prove to you that 20 years before 9/11 happened people in upper corporate management, knew it was gonna happen.

176986,"How to enjoy anything again?So I have severe depression and anxiety and, as some of us are aware, depression literally prevents us from finding enjoyment in life. I've spent the past 18 years playing the ""let's try this anti-depressant"" game and out of those 18 years there was only one medicine whose effect only last for two years that made me feel ""normal"" in that I was able to wake up and be capable of being in a happy mood. All the other time I've just been in Limbo Land or the Valley of Desired Death.

My issue, or question really, is how does one find enjoyment when nothing brings enjoyment? I mean literally nothing brings me any sense of enjoyment. Everything that at one time made me even the slightest bit happy is gone. I do things nowadays not because I'm enjoying it but simply out of routine or the false hope that I'll actually enjoy it again.

Granted, my depression is at its worst and the various new meds I've tried have only made things worse in one area or another. I already have plans to kill myself that I've slowly been prepping for but I would like it if I didn't feel that that was the best option to me. My doctor, my family, and my life in general isn't helping any of this and quite literally none of it will even be possible to change for reasons that are a bit out of my control and that is its own story as to why.

So, long story short, how does one find enjoyment when all enjoyment is dead? Should I just force myself to do things that should be good for me for the possible and slim chance it might improve things? You know like eating healthy, exercising routinely, attempting to be social - all things I stopped even considering much less even doing what with the current prep work and future plans I've put my thought into.

Depression is the destroyer of hope. Any hope ""might"" help as I've none left at all and this is a first for me and it's not going away even after all these months.",depression

I dont want to overdose because I know I will be crying when I start feeling the effects of the drug. I want to die in a sudden. When I get the courage that moment, I want to end my life.

294271,"Have a chronic, disabling illness which keeps getting worseI have schizophrenia, and because of this illness, I ended up being completely disabled. Even though I take treatment which works as intended, the treatment for schizophrenia is only made to target a small part of the symptoms of this disabling condition, without addressing most symptoms.

I've experienced a severe cognitive decline, lost my social ability, and my ability to function. I also can't experience any pleasure anymore - life seems dull and monotone, and it has lost all of its color. My emotions are gone. And to make things worse, I have a hard time speaking and making sentences (although it's not as visible when typing).

There's no treatment for these symptoms - medication only treats symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. It doesn't treat progressive decline associated with this illness.

The illness is getting worse and worse. My mental state keeps deteriorating. 

Also, I recently demanded for my medical records to be handed out to me. I read them, and it said that when I went back to a new school after being hospitalized and treated, the school contacted the hospital saying that the students were ""disturbed"" when I joined their class, and that some even feared me.

Are there any alternatives to killing myself? Not only did I lose everything, but chances are, it will only get worse with time.

I have everything planned out already, and I'm not afraid of going through with it anymore. I chose highly fatal methods, because if I will survive, my life will be even worse - I will get hospitalized against my will for indefinite amounts of time.",depression
92151,"I need some advice. [HUGE rant warning]This isn't about me, personally.

My best friend (we'll call her Mary) knows this small group of people, and has known them for about two months now.
She's been dating this one girl for all of three days, and that girl (we'll call her Alice) is the best friend of another girl (we'll call her Jane).

Here's where things get bad. Last night Mary calls me at around eleven, saying Alice told her Jane went missing. Mary had an argument with Jane a few days ago and Mary immediately starts to think it's her fault something is going bad. 

Hearing Mary freak out I go to her house to be with her. Mary and I have been best friends for four years, her family is like mine, etc. No word is given until about midnight when they find out that Jane had a gun, but there was no bullets in it and she couldn't have gotten to them anyway.

Needless to say, Mary is freaking out. Eventually after no words, Mary's dad tells her that she should come spend the night at my house so she has someone to be with her. 

We go to sleep, we wake up, no word. We both assume that this means that Jane came home and everything is okay.

Around 10am this morning, Alice calls Mary. Jane had shot herself. 


All hell breaks loose in my house for awhile, Mary is in hysterics (naturally), and we try to convince her that this isn't her fault. She calms down once her dad arrives. Her father doesn't want her to go to Alice's house so he asks her to stay with me. Mary invites Alice and one of her friends who knew Jane to my house.

It seems like a good point to mention I have never ever met Jane, I've heard about her and she knows about me, but that's the extent of their relationship.

TL;DR - My best friend's girlfriend's best friend committed suicide, and now my best friend and her girlfriend are at my house. 

Eventually. Mary and Alice go to Alice's house with Mary's dad's permission. My mother, however, refuses to let me go, even though Mary wants me there. 

Part of me feels like it's not my place. Well, most of me feels that way since I didn't know Jane, and only met Alice in person today.
Part of me also feels like Mary is in way over her head, because she's only known this girl a week, and only been dating Alice for three days. 

But then again, I feel like I should be there for Mary. She asked me if I wanted to come, and earlier she said I should go. But then I feel like she doesn't want me or need me.

What do I do? I feel like I'm Mary's best chance at calming down and sorting things out - because I've known her longer, and I'm pretty much her sister. But then again, I don't have much of a place in the situation.

I've been there for her, and I still am, and I will sit here and wait patiently until she needs me like all of the adults tell me to. That's not really what I'm asking, what I'm asking is, what's someones take on this?

130457,"Feeling Like Now's the Time24 year old male here who's lived the common, mundane loser existence. 

I was in college for 5 years before I took the semester off this time around. I got my first job at 21 and it was hell from the start. I had no experience with the work and my coworkers and bosses didn't like me.

I quit my job after about 2 years last March without telling my parents. Last spring semester was terrible academically. I never studied and barely got by. There was no interest in the field I was studying and going to class was a chore and ultimately pointless. 

I've had social anxiety and depression since age 12 and no real friends since then. No luck with women either, considering I lost my virginity to an escort 6 months ago. That lead to an addiction to them that got progressively worse. I don't think it's a sex addiction, though it may be. I just think I enjoyed being around someone other than my family on a daily basis. I found this one escort in July that I developed feelings for. I know it's pathetic but it happened. I blew almost every cent of my $15,000 savings on her. We had a falling out a few days ago which was mainly my fault. I didn't want to tell her I have no money left so I just brought up things in the past she's done that got under my skin in order to drive her away.

The worst part is that my parents recently found out about everything. They're the helicopter type parents who got suspicious as to where I was going every day. While I was driving back from seeing the escort for the final time my mom sent me a text saying she went through the phone bill and saw the escorts number. I was so embarrassed that I drove to an empty parking lot and tried to hang myself inside my car with my belt. Now my parents are understandably pissed at me and trying to get me back on track. But the sad part is that I don't want to go back to what I was doing. I woke up every day looking forward to seeing an escort and spending the rest of the day doing nothing. I told myself that I would commit suicide when the money ran out, but I haven't worked up the courage. I did try to hang myself again a few days ago, but I got scared and quit. 

Has anybody else felt like this before? I had a small amount of time to live in my own personal paradise, but now that it's over I feel like there's no point in continuing.",depression

I know he is probably just pissed at me right now because I’m suicidal but you know fuck him at this point because he is a huge reason I’m killing myself. I tried to give my all to him and make him the happiest on earth and show him how much he meant to me and he basically took a whole ass shit on my feelings today and when I said I was going to leave this earth he simply said ‘okay’ this man has ruined my whole life and I let him. I lost myself so long ago and it would feel amazing to die it would feel like a decision I got to make for myself for once. Something that would take away all of my pain. It sounds so fucking comforting right now. Just sucks I didn’t get my gun in time.

142978,"I feel so hopeless.I feel like my parents have always and continue to spoil me without me deserving it. School has been making me feel like absolute shit. I'm studying architecture and if I don't raise my GPA by .1 (yup) by this Fall I'm going to have to wait until Fall 2019 to continue my education (this is my 3rd year in uni, 2nd out of 5 years in the program). If that happens my plan is to intern full-time so I can get plenty of hours, but I'm so scared I won't want to go back to school. I hate it. Raising my GPA by .1 seems like it'll be easy but so far in one of my classes my two (out of four) exam scores have been 60 and 42. I'm only taking 3 classes but I'm barely putting any effort into 2 of them. 

I feel absolutely exhausted all day. Caffeine makes me feel even more tired, and I really can't function if I don't take a nap at some point (I drive home at either 1pm or 6-7pm and I'm always falling asleep on the way). I barely have the energy to keep up with school, much less do any hobbies. I'm in a LDR (my boyfriend lives 7 hours away) and I only get to see him once or twice a month. My relationship with him is very important to me, and I often get sad that I can't hug him or physically be with him. I have a few friends, but in general I avoid physical contact with people as much as possible. I love my parents, but I just feel very uncomfortable having physical contact with anyone apart from my boyfriend.
I've been on medication for depression/anxiety for the past year, and while I've improved a lot, it kinda went from me feeling sad a lot to just feeling...nothing. I've become so much more apathetic. It's really hard for me to see any color in this world. I keep going because the logical side of my brain tells me that this isn't permanent, but I rarely feel any happiness in my daily life.

I feel like this is really taking a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend. He is a very optimistic, positive person and I feel so horribly guilty for bringing him down with my negativity. I feel like he deserves so much better than me. The only two things stopping me from killing myself sometimes are 1. Fear of what comes after and 2. My parents. I know everyone else will move on (and they deserve it, especially my boyfriend) but my parents won't. I'm their only child, the apple of their eye, they would NEVER get over my death. They would blame themselves forever, and I love them so much that I don't ever want to put them through that. I pretend that I'm fine so they don't worry, but fuck it's getting so hard. I've stopped going to therapy because I feel like it's just a waste of their money. I failed a couple of classes a few semesters ago causing me to lose my scholarships, and while my uni isn't expensive, I feel so shitty having them pay that. The worst part is that they just continue to throw money at me despite the fact that I'm barely putting any effort into school or into anything in general. Just this weekend I went to Universal and got kicked out within 20 minutes of being there, so $200 went to total waste. FUck I feel so fucking guilty.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm not going to get anywhere in life. I'm barely putting effort into anything (I seriously spend most of my time either sleeping or fantasizing about sleeping) and I feel like it's only a matter of time before my boyfriend leaves me. My anxiety causes me to make stupid assumptions makes me guilt-trip him and be passive aggressive and it just really puts a strain on my relationship. I hate it. I hate myself so much. I want to take a bunch of klonopin, zoloft, alcohol, sleeping pills, whatever the hell I can find and just die, but I couldn't put my parents through that. If you read all of this, sorry for the lack of organization. I just have a lot of thoughts and I seriously just feel so lost.

TLDR; School is stressing me the fuck out and I feel guilty as hell for letting my anxiety put such strain on my relationships. I have no idea what to do from here.",depression

295818,"I keep on thinking about how involuntary most of my life is.I feel as if I have people subtly telling me how to live every day, subtly suggesting I conform to some set of principles which will improve my social standing in the system we have set up today. Some of the best people I've ever known have believed in me for who I am, it's so strange some of those friendships faded away after college yet many of the ones which are so toxic seem to have persisted. I mean there are definitely redeeming qualities for my friends and family, I don't want to say they're not everything I wanted or expect. I have no expectations for them, it's just that ideologically I am fiercely against many perspectives which feel untouched by their critical senses. Like, sometimes I feel as if the challenge I face is convincing people my values are actually correct and I do believe they are but they involve some pretty radical life changes in order to actually accept them so I really feel the pressure to adapt or augment for people. 

I just don't like being the odd man out anymore, I don't like being untalented, stressed, undervalued. I don't like to pretend my pain is less than it is, I don't want to punish anyone I just want to be done with this part of my life and it's being extended and extended the further into poverty I fall.  I'm ready to accept death but it won't accept me either, nothing I say or do will ever fill this void of purpose.

Let me tell you my story. I am Aquarius, and most of my life I had it bad. Bad luck all of my life. Just when I tough everything was going to be ok for once, life lied to me once again. It decided to crush my dreams 1 more time. I always had this idea of creating a company that pursued experimentation in the arts, technology, and entertainment. and had the idea for about 4 years. I invested all of my money into making it work, but of course it needed more money. A lot of money, which resulted in hundreds of rejection letters from investors. Until 1 person came along, a ""private"" piece of shit investor scammer that pretty much killed my dreams 1 more time. Just when I tough, God finally did listen to me, angels had my back, this shit happens. And is not pretty. I found out it was a scam after a month, me thinking that I had money somewhere else, and they ask me for money to withdraw the money that was suppose to be mine. I am Aqua, and pretty smart, but this flew over my radar. I apologize to anyone that I tried to hire, and wanted to be part of my company. Went from suicidal to having hope again to finally suicidal again. I decided I am going to kill my self in 4 days. I debated on doing it, about 10 times. and this is it. 

I watched an Anime called Serial Experiments Lain a few weeks ago, and pretty much is about Suicide. I won't spoil it! :P but is good, and has a good philosophy behind it. We are all connected, like this post. People on the internet care more about killing yourself than your own fucking family who fucking ignore you. Sad

Anyway, I am ready to go home, I did some studies about what happens after death, and seems like the best answer is not to go to the light, in order to don't remain trapped in this fucking piece of shit matrix. I am a rebel by nature lol I stopped working, quit school, because fuck being normal. This is when I found out I was glitching the matrix, and the only way out is death. Sometimes I wish I never opened my third eye. 

I also prepared my family to don't miss me, stopped talking to almost everyone, and barely see them. So is good, at least they wont remember me.

296488,"Not for me, but the love of my life is scarily depressed right now, and this is an accurate username.I know, it's not me, but I'm really frightened and I feel awful. Here's what's going on.

I've been in a relationship for a little over six months with a woman from work who I had a serious crush on for about six months before that. When she's herself, she's wonderful. She's uproariously funny, kind, quick-witted, and amazing. And she loves me as much as I love her. I would like to marry her someday.

But she - like me, it should be noted - is a pretty serious depressive. I've been coping with it pretty well since the real onset about a decade ago (I'm almost 30, she's fresh out of college, yeah, I know), and I've never been anything close to suicidal, though I did have a spell of panic attacks a few years back that were pretty rotten.

She's been depressed since her early teens, and has tried to kill herself more than once. I don't know tons of the details about the attempts, but I believe her when she tells me.

Recently, she's really been struggling. We work at the same place, and although she's among the best in the office at what we do, she hates the place like poison and really, really wants to leave. I don't blame her - working conditions really aren't the best and management is kind of stupid and dishonest - and I've got no problem with that, despite the fact that one of the possible outcomes would be her moving home (4-5 hours away) and the possible end of our relationship. I'd be crushed, but at least she wouldn't be alone.

Sometimes she gets day-long spells of just being miserable lately. She's OK at work, but can't stop crying when she gets home. She just got off the phone with me - a call during which she said many times ""I can't take it"" - because she was going to start crying.

I don't believe she's going to kill herself. But I love her so much and the very idea makes me feel empty.

She seems so fragile, in these moods, though. I try to be kind and cheerful - while being careful to be respectful and not trying to solve her problems for her - but it doesn't seem to work. She usually just gets better on her own. She says I'm one of ""the few bright spots"" in her life right now.

What can I do? I'd do anything to help her, but I've been seriously depressed before and I know you don't just snap out of it. It takes hard work and time. Is there anything I can do to help? Or to stop myself from feeling this horrible when she gets like this?",depression

248063,"Whenever something goes terribly wrong, I just think of ending it.Hey guys,

I don't know if this qualifies as depression or something that needs immediate attention, but I usually have days where when shit hits the fan, something goes wrong, stupid amounts of stress, or I just over react to something I get into this thought provoking overly critical judgmental view of myself that I don't snap out of until the next day. I think about what I've done wrong, how it's affected me, how worthless I am, and the list goes on. It's like a never ending cycle of self loathing.

 Now I posted here instead of /r/depression because I definitely have thought about just ending it. More or less every time I get into this mood. How often it occurs is maybe once a week, sometimes less and sometimes more. 

Perhaps it's a cry for attention/help, maybe I'm just being a spoiled little shit, or I do have a problem. I'm better off than most people why do I think like this. I don't know. I never do just end it because I keep thinking I would be a little shit for not dealing with life. I keep telling myself that it's a bitch move and I'm better than that. But the other day I just looked at a bottle of tylenol when it was an amazingly shitty day and I stared it for awhile.

**Note** I'm not trying to advocate my way of dealing with this, I'm just trying to get this off my chest.

Now that we are done with that little lecture, let’s get into my trip through sobriety. I have been sober for 5 days, yippee I know. But it has been a lot harder than I thought. I’ve been drinking to run from my problems but Jesus Christ I have a lot more problems than I thought. And now I got the problem with having to stop myself from drinking on top of everything else. Do you know how hard it is to stay sober when everyone around you talks about it and uses it? When it is on every damn tv screen, tv show, even at the dinner table every damn day? It fucking sucks.

Whether or not I’ll break my sobriety tonight I’m not sure. I’ve got a lot on my mind and can’t get drinking off my mind. And thinking about it, I watched a South Park episode today that I oddly really related to. Here’s the plot, Stan begins to see everything as shit and becomes a cynical asshole. His friends leave him and he gets depressed, just going through the motions. He gets sent to a treatment place where some matrix looking people make him drink to make him feel like he did before and he becomes an alcoholic. Eventually only making things worse.

To my family: I am so sorry for the grief and guilt I’m leaving you with.  I know every single person in this family is going to feel guilty, because of me, and I hate that so much.  This isn’t your fault.  I wish I could take that away, you don’t deserve it.  I pushed you all away.  I couldn’t say goodbye, because I’ve made up my mind, and I don’t want to risk you feeling any worse, in case you’re not ready to forgive me.  I know you would, especially if you knew what was coming, but I’m leaving regardless.

Please have a group hug for me, because I would have really loved to hug you all one last time.  I’m so sorry I didn’t say goodbye, but this will have to do.

My motive is pretty self evident, but if you need me to clarify: my entire life slipped away.  The loss of \[ex-wife\], onset mental illness, and severe depression.  There is no hope for me now, I’ve lost too much.  My entire world is razed.  I have no purpose, and nothing I’m looking forward to.  I’ve lost all passion and will to live.  I can’t go on, and I don’t want to.  I don’t want what’s left, and I don’t want to rebuild.  I’m not interested in the unknown opportunities, the past is going to haunt me always.  Please try to appreciate every moment and every thing, because it will all end at some point in time.

I want you to remember the happy memories we’ve shared, and not any sad ones.  It’s okay to remember the happy times with \[ex-wife\] too.  She was so great, and good to me.  But I gave too much of my life to her, I trusted her forever, and I didn’t realize what I had until she was gone - my biggest regret.  I tried to convince myself I didn’t love her, but I did, so much, and I still do.  I’m sorry I lost her to you as well.  And I’m sorry for any embarrassment you feel as a result of this.

I’m sorry about the loose ends, but at least I was able to leave you some money.  Trust me, I know you would still want me here instead, but I’m happy I can leave you with something.  Please have 15% go to Mom and Dad, and 42.5% each to \[brothers\].  I just decided to split it this way based on need.  I love you all equally, truly.  More than you know.  I’m sorry I didn’t say and show it more.  Any related expenses to come off the top.  I hope this makes your lives a little easier in time.  I don’t know how much it will be, but don’t feel guilty to do whatever you want with it.  I wanted you to have this, and I want you to enjoy your lives.

My passing was peaceful and painless.  I drank pentobarbital.  I didn’t do it because it was easy.  I did it because my life is too hard, my reality too harsh, my future too grim, and my past too good.  Please have me cremated, and I do not want my ashes in an urn or my name engraved anywhere.  Sprinkle some in an herb plant if you wish, like \[aunt\].  Feel free to have a celebration of life at home with the extended family when you are okay to do so.  I know it’s going to be sad, but I hope there are laughs and love too.

I love you all, I’m sorry that I let you down.  I did this for me, I’m not staying here for anyone else.  Please don’t think of me as selfish, I just know my life is over.  You couldn’t have saved me, I did this to myself, and I’m going on my terms now.  I feel terrible about the pain I’m leaving you with, but I don’t want to suffer anymore.  Every single day has been a struggle.  I’m sorry for making your lives harder, I really hate that part because I love you all so much.  And you’re allowed to feel whatever emotions you want towards me, even anger.  I understand.  But know I’ve already accepted your eventual forgiveness into my heart.  I hope this can bring you all closer.  Life is short, and I don’t want you to spend more time than you have to dwelling in sadness.  I want you to be strong for each other.  One of us had to die first, I’m sorry it was me.

Please know I’m at peace with my end.  If there is an afterlife, I’ll be seeing you in time.  I hope there is, but I’m okay if there isn’t too.  I’ve had my fun here, now it’s time for me to go.

I am going to fail school because i have no ability to do anything (im not dumb, I just have no energy, no ability to start things, no ability to think,) i had explicit dot points I just had to change into complete sentences. i just couldn't. took me three hours to do like 2 paragraphs some members of my family will attack me for that. writing this is really tiring too, but i need to get it out to think because i cant think inside my head anymore
I've layed in bed for three days straight, only coming out to have one meal, and go to the toilet.
im so trumatized. basically, you name it, it's been done to me. rape, attempted murder, my mum was a junkie when i was unborn ( i tihnk that's where a lot of my brain problems come from) I can't function, but people expect me too
I've gone psychotic like my father, but no professional believes me. last month i was convinced i was talking to demons and that everyone either fake or working ffor the aliens that control the world. i have pages on pages of song lyrics rearranged to form messages. ( im not having an episode right now, but i can feel the paranoia coming again)
but 'it's just part of your religion' ' it's just your imagination' ' you don't see things, it's just tricks of the light'

and like if he can't understand why the hell she can't go in her room at the moment. he's not going to understand anything about me.
heard him say 'her fault for leading him on' she's only 15.... honestly if he said it again I would knock him flat, i don't care.
but im not well enough to live on my own.
i can't go into hospital because i don't trust medical stufff because the past two doctors i've seen have been either imcompetent or abusive.

I have an idea for a podcast that I would like to create.

The  premise behind the podcast is that I take a group of about 2 to 3  teenagers and we create a couple episodes with a group on various  topics.

We would have an  introductory episode where we all learn more about each other. Then  perhaps an episode regarding aliens, or religion, or politics,  conspiracy theories or any topic the group would like to discuss.

Depending  how eager the group is, we may have 1 or 2 episodes together or 10. The  only requirement is that we are all similar in age, and that we are  open to listen and have thoughtful conversations.

Hopefully  we could all get to know each other and have some fun, meaningful,  interactions. If you are interested please fill out this google form. If  you have any questions please ask below.

It only got worse the next couple of years, and when I was 12, I got denied many things.  My first audition to become an actrice, which was fair, but I also failed an audition for a school play and I failed to get into a special english class, both I cared so much for. 

It only became worse when I thought of the future, I was sure I wouldn't get a job  and become a poor piece of shit. So I tried it once more, i came back to the same bridge, climbed over the railing, but I couldn't let go. I thought of my friends and even my family, which has caused me much trauma's.

This schoolyear was even worse, I got called names behind my back and I didn't even trust my friends. The whole year, every day, 24/7, i thought of the trauma's my family gave me. I can't trust my family,  I am too embarrassed to do anything when they are around, they laugh at me and my brother used to hit me everytime i stood up to him.

135183,"Ramblings of a broken 19yoTL;DR: I'm at a point in life where I don't even know what I need to do, how I need to do it. It feels like my entire life is being wasted and I don't have the mental energy to keep going on

So where the fuck do I begin. I got no bloody idea. Lets just go trough the timeline I guess

I was born in Canada, in a poor family, with a( at the time) violent, depressed father and a bordeline mother. Along the childhood we  moved.... I honestly lost track how many time honestly.... from Montreal, Laval, Ottawa, Gatineau.... Basically destroying any chance of truly understanding how to form a proper social network and how to socialize because I just kept moving so fucking much it was basically pointless to try since you'd lose contact right after... I digress. Point being we moved a lot.

Most of my social interactions that I did manage to get were stale and bland, mixed with a sprinkle of absolute psychotic. Most happening in school, because fuck me if anyone ever invited me to anything ever after school, People usually had one of the two thoughts about me: ""He's weird asf"" or ""He's annoying asf"" pick and choose. So obviously I spend most of my elementary, middle and high school doing pretty much the same shit alone. Alone being the key part. I've done a lot of personality test and introversion tests and its clear that, although being ambivert, I'm extroverted dominant. Reason I say this is sometime I need social interaction. I got everything I could of wanted, except that. In the end I'm starting to think people will all succeed because of just that: they got friend henceforth they got potential life opportunities. I got none of that. Now I know I've been rambling pretty much this entire time but I had to ramble somewhere and this subreddit seemed a decent candidate. But then again I doubt myself so fucking much all the time because intelligence is the only mildly attractive quality I may posses. So of course when my intellect is challenge I start dying inside because my validation that I'm a human piece of garbage with no assets to call his own. 

I'm poor, weird, ostracized to absolute shit, have depression, Asperger syndrome, Atrial septum defect, low blood pressure, Probably malnutrition because, again, were poor.

I'm not even sure how to turn my life around if it's even possible. I'm to tired to search, yet I don't wanna die. I just wanna cease existing, if that makes sense. I want people to forget I ever existed so I can just disapeared.

And If anyone blames my behavior on my depression, don't; I know. Thing is, its not as simple as going to a clinic where I live; I've been waiting for years in a stupid waiting list and I still only got a psychologist who can at most prescribe me stupid fucking ssris that dont work, I was on Prozac when I was a kid and I didn't work back, now they put me on sertraline (zoloft) and I guess that didn't do its job either

So yeah. Im done, im going to bed. I hope I don't wake up.

The point is... I can't seem to find a way to fix all of my problems, because I've made so much mistakes that those will follow me for the rest of my life. I'm toxic, I annoy people, I make others hate me, I made my mom and family spend a lot of money for treatment, and even after those, I still couldn't find an answer...

I’ve stopped being able to see my psychologist, and I’m not getting any more meds. I know there’s other ways out, but suicide seems like easiest option, and the one that would spite her the most.",depression
52548,"I think I saved somebody's life tonight SWI was chatting to a friend of a friend on facebook chat this evening started telling her of all my mediocre problems. She listened and helped. In return I promised to listen to her story and I tried to make her think positively just like she did with me.  I promised her I would do all I could to help but as she told me she was contemplating ""the 's' word"" but only for our small, not hugely personal conversation, she would have killed herself. As I write I'm still talking to her, shit scared what to say but know that as a result of my action I saved a life. I beg of anyone reading this, 10-20 minutes of your time can honestly save a life.

239900,"friend on suicide watchHi everyone,   
I'm new to reddit &amp; this is my first post. I wish my first post could be something a bit more positive, but life isn't fair so whatevs.

Recently a close friend of mine (17 M) took LSD &amp; we think it triggered something in his mind, because now he's really depressed, on suicide watch, &amp; his family thinks he might be schizophrenic. We (his friends &amp; fam) don't think the LSD was a direct cause of his mental illness, because right after his experience everyone that hung out with him felt as though he was normal &amp; then progressively got worse. Which led us to believe that perhaps the LSD simply triggered his underlying mental disorder to emerge now rather than later in his future. 

I, myself, have my own share of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, &amp; OCD to name a few, &amp; I used to be suicidal as well. I want to help my friend but idk what to do other than hang out with him &amp; make sure he doesn't do anything stupid. Hanging out with him makes me feel so useless because I can't help. Especially bc I've experienced a lot of the of the same symptoms he's currently experiencing now, though obviously not to the same extent . It feels so ridiculous &amp; frustrating to hear him describe the exact same thing I feel, &amp; then be at a complete loss for words and not be able to offer any advice.

I'm still here despite my incredibly pessimistic &amp; depressed personality, but I simply don't know what I can do to help him find joy in life again. My first year of college I used climb to the top of the parking garage &amp; stand as close to the ledge as I could &amp; dare myself to jump. I also have a past of self-harm, though mine was/is physical &amp; his form of self harm is risky behavior. I understand the antsiness he describes about being stuck at home &amp; I completely relate &amp; understand. I don't think sharing my mental health experiences with him would be healthy bc recently he's been adopting other people's behavior or self-diagnosing with anything he reads about.

On top of everything else, it feels like all our other friends abandoned him. I understand that it's difficult for them to visit him bc he no longer talks/acts like the same person we've all known for so long. In a way it feels like they are already mourning the death of our ""old"" version of him, but I feel he's still himself, just with no will to live. 

I'm starting school soon &amp; so is he, he's taking on a full 13 units this semester. I know the upcoming semester is going to stress him out (bc school stresses everyone out), but I was just looking for suggestions on how I can help him, since I'm completely useless to him at the moment. 

When life gets bleak &amp; grey for you guys what do you do to make yourself care again?

one thing that helps for me, is I find things to look forward to, even tiny things. My currently thing is snapchat streaks. but I know that this form of coping can be dangerous, bc if you lose one of the things you look forward to, it can wreak havoc on your mental health. 

If you don't have anything you do yourself to bring yourself back, then what is something you wish others would do? 

Any feedback would be insanely appreciated guys, thanks in advance!",depression

284639,"Now what?It has been about 2 years since my wife developed a drinking problem. It is the strangest thing. She doesn’t even drink a lot. She has as little as a small grass of wine and becomes Mr. Hyde. She has been abusive to our three children and myself during these episodes. She has been hospitalized for the drinking and mental health issues on two occasions. We have been together for 15 years. I love her. Damn do I love her.

Starting in early February I tried to leave on a couple occasions. On the most recent occasion, I slept with a woman other than my wife for the first time in our relationship. It was fairly good sex but shortly after parting ways for the night it occurred to me that I don’t want to sleep with anyone other than my wife. Sex without love just doesn’t seem worth it. I love my wife. I went home. Things were good for a week or so.

We had been dealing with a stressful housing situation for several months and that finally ended. We had a day off together. The kids were in school and we just spent the day together in bed. No sex just being together. It was great. The next day she went to work and had a glass of wine at lunch. Mr. Hyde came home and we argued. I tried my damndest to keep her together but she left. Took a cab to her mom’s and called me a couple days later begging for another chance. I told her that I loved her and that I would always give her another chance. She said her mom would bring her home the next day. The next day came and she wouldn’t answer the phone. She text me that night to say that she wasn’t coming home. She said she was tired of disappointing me and that she knew deep down that she would never stop the drinking. I drove down to her moms house to find out she went to his house.

He is a person she had described as her little brother. He was a part of a friends group she ran with as a kid/teenager. He has spent 12 of the last 15 years in and out of prison. Forgery, car theft, burglary, aggravated assault and theft round out his activities. These days it isn’t hard for inmates to get cell phones and 2 years ago I noticed that she posted this on his Facebook.

“Miss you! Thinking of you all and I hope you are doing okay. I dreamed of you last night, so I hope all is well. xoxo”

I thought that was inappropriate for a married woman to send to another man and I asked her to stop talking to him. She agreed and complied for a couple years until he was released on 2/17/2020. She started talking to him at work or when I left the house. I found out but she just reiterated that he was just like a little brother. When I found out that she went to him. I lost it. I drove to California and got stupid stoned. I walked a hole in my thighs pacing miles down the beach. She called me right as I got back in my truck. She called me a coward for leaving the kids with her mom. Ran me down some more and guilted me into returning to northern Arizona. I got home at 3am. She was sleeping next to her phone and I picked it up, read her text to him and knew they where romantic. I woke her. She told me it was over. I begged. She was steadfast. I told her I couldn’t live without her. She was steadfast. She ran out of the house and I walked away, got in my truck and called the Suicide Prevention Hotline. (what a joke that is) They sent the police to the house and she tried to coax me home with the police listening in on speaker phone. I knew better and drove to Phoenix. I had a plan but didn’t want to die. I love myself, I love being a husband and a father. This was 2/25/2020.

She told me she was going to focus on herself. Learn how to be independent. We met when she was 18. I was 21. She had almost no life skills. I pretty much raised her. She was a ward of the state and her parents never prepared her for life neither did the state. She spent most of her teenage years in juvenile prison. She moved into a shelter in Northern AZ and I lived in my truck in Phoenix. The shelter kicked her out for testing positive for drugs. She pawned our kids off on her mom and moved in with him. Our business was over now as a result of all that had happened and I got a physically demanding job. I slept in my truck, showered at the gym and busted my ass. We talked. I tried to be a friend to her. I need her in my life. One night while I was working she called me and I walked away from the line and hid while talking to her. He pissed her off and she ran to me. I told her I would do whatever I had to do to get her back. We ended the conversation with 30 or so I love you’s back and forth. The next day she said she had no memory of that conversation. She was blacked out. I was doing okay before that. Then I was crushed. Again. She text me later that night to tell me that our 13 year old daughter had stole her grandmas pot and given it to my wife. I called my daughter on my lunch break and she told me that my wife had put her up to it. Going so far as to boost my daughter into an unlocked window to go get this pot. Who was this person? It was totally out of character. I turned her in and went and got my babies. That was 3/7/2020.

It was easy to pretend to hate her after that. I felt better about having lost her as she wasn’t the same person anymore. I ignored her texts. I made arraignments for my daughters to stay at their respective best friends and my son and I stayed with a friend. Last weekend she called me to ask if I could locate her phone. She got into it with him. Left his house, drank a half gallon of vodka and somehow fell and broke a rib. Come to find out he was pushing her to file for divorce and she wasn’t ready. My mother-in-law told me that this asshole used to beat his mom. It has become obvious that he is trying to isolate her. He is pretty much going through the check list of shit that abuses do to trap their victims. I love my wife.

I don’t know what to do. My job is on hiatus because of Corona. My wife is wrapped up in a psycho. My kids are begging me to fight for full custody. I’m basically homeless. I’m suicidal. I need to run. If I keep doing this I’m afraid I will kill myself or him. If I leave her the kids and run they will hate me and probably end up in state custody. I want to run. I’m useless to my kids like this.",depression

232297,"I'm getting closer and closer...I have been depressed since 13 years old. Every year I get worse and worse. At the beginning of 2016 I was pretty bad, but I thought suicide was stupid.

 A year after that, I hit rock bottom and thought about it every single day. I've gotten out of that slump, but I'm still not ok. After that, the only thing holding me back was the fact that theres no easy way to get the job done.

A few days ago set up and tested a noose and its solid. I dont even need to leave my bedroom. Whats stopping me now? 

About 4 months ago, I used to always think about how just the year before I laughed at the idea of suicide and now look at me.. thinking about it every day. I used to ask myself ""If it only took a year to get from that point to this point, where will I be in 1 more year?"".. 
But now Im starting to ask myself ""Where am I gonna be in a month? Where am I gonna be in a week?""",depression
99748,"I need helpThis is not about me directly. A girlfriend in another country has had a family member a 19 Yo boy, the son of her sister commit suicide yesterday. 1 year ago the brother of her sister's husband also committed suicide. She herself has told me she has struggled with suicidal thoughts. The whole family is 1 day into this. How do I suggest they all get counseling without sounding like a busy body.
The complexity is we were recconnecting via email after a 7 year absence from each others lives. Making plans to visit and now this.
I don't expect her to answer my emails right now and maybe never.
I am worried about her primarily but I think the whole family may need some counseling now with 2 people in 2 years.
Her sister is a palliative care nurse so she has dealt with loss but this is much different. Her son. For my girlfriend its a bitter loss because she can not have children. Her first email to me said.""What did we do that was so bad? ''  I am miles away I knew she would say no but I had to ask if she needed me to come to be there for her. I know she will be there for her sister and the rest of the family but my selfish urge was to want to be there for her. 
I am not sure what to do. I feel like everything we were planning is just over now. Its a big family for her a dozen kids dotted around the country. They will all be getting together now for the worst of all possible reasons. 19 years old and gone. We are much older in our 40's and  mid 50's but still this is going to be a very sad year or two.
Any help with an approach that is appropriate would be appreciated

79065,"I don't know how to startI don't know what to say. My life is so wonderful yet so terrible at the same time. I have a loving family who supports me for the most part (my dad has severe anger issues when he gets mad but I still love him because he's my father) I don't think my parents have a happy marriage though. It just seems kind of dull. We never do fun things as a family like we did when we were little. They try to get me to do family stuff with them yet I never want to, it just doesn't interest me anymore. I don't do anything bad. The only thing I ever get in trouble for is bad grades. I'll admit it I'm pretty lazy. I try to do good in school but I stop caring and I can't bring myself to care about my school work. I can't really bring myself to care about anything. I care about other people and I try to help everyone best I can, even just strangers online. But sometimes it feels like no one is there to help me when I need it. People come to me for support all the time and as soon as I need it from them they seem to just not care as if I'm not their problem. I can't talk to my parents about anything, my mom seems to be the only one who cares about my feelings. My dad doesn't really give a shit but it's okay I don't think he understands. Sometimes I think he feels the same way I do about everything except he hides it better. A few weeks ago I got my first job. Neither of my parents are working as of lately, just been living off my dad compensation for a work related injury. We've never had a lot of money and we almost lost our house (again) a few months ago. I've been with a girl I met online (I know online relationships don't tend to work out well but I really love her) for the past 7 months. It started really awesome but I think I've gotten to attached to her. I know she loves me and I know I love her but sometimes I feel like she doesn't even care about me. Sometimes we fight a lot too but other times things are perfect. I'm not unhappy with her, she's a really sweet and loving girlfriend. But sometimes it's just so hard to communicate about our emotions because of the distance and being afraid of what the other will think. Sometimes I think of breaking up with her even though I don't want to and neither does she. The only people who seem to care about me at all are my mom, my girlfriend, and a few online friends. My real friends have forgotten about me. I've also forgotten about them. In school I feel like a ghost so I just go on my phone most of the day. I don't pay attention I just scroll Instagram instead of doing My work. I always lie when asked about homework and say that I finish it in class but really I just don't do it. I got my third term report card two weeks ago and I failed 3 classes. That's the worst I've had since 7th grade (I'm a junior currently) and I'm afraid to show my parents. I know my dad would probably be the angriest I've ever seen. Back in middle school he used to hit me sometimes when I'd come home with a bad report card. He's not a bad man so when he would calm down he would apologize and talk it out.  He's ""addicted"" to weed. He's smoked everyday since he was my age. He's only happy when he's high. He doesn't know that I know this, I found his stash one day in our camper and told my mom. She broke down and started explaining to me all about it. It's upsetting. I don't look up to him as a father figure. To be honest I don't really have one from the feel of it. I look up to my mother for her kindness, nothing more than that as well. A few months back I started messing with pills to try to get high. I started taking my moms anti depressants and oh boy they made me feel great at first but slowly started to her weaker. One day I decided to take 8 doses. Didn't end well... then I start d playing with prescription ibuprofen that I found (800mg which is max allowed dose to be prescribed here) and it made me feel happy. Jumpy as hell but happy. The past few weeks I've been feeling really low but also kinda happy too. It's weird, I feel so shitty yet  feel like it doesn't matter. In a way I guess I just feel neutral, almost empty. And I hate it. I used to take methylphenidate and still have a lot left. I looked it up today and it's turns out the overdose is usually fatal and isn't a super high dose. I just don't want to do this anymore. I feel so pressured and overwhelmed by everything in my life. I've thought of running away from home. I always wanted to leave the state as soon as I graduate high school. What am I gonna do just keep running? Has to end somewhere right? So why bother? I just don't want to live like this anymore but I don't know how to fix it. To be honest I feel like I've become so absorbed that I can't. I think I'm gonna do it but I don't know.

171139,"I don't want to exist anymoreI've attempted multiple before when I younger but it never worked so I gave up and I just feel like I'm trapped and forced to stay alive.  I hate this. I just want to go away and just disappear. I feel like my entire existence is just a giant ball of bad luck. 

I hate being stuck in my city, I hate living with my family, but I have no choice, I'm stuck in a college I never wanted to go to, I have nothing to live for besides my cat and he's getting old. I just gave away a feral cat that I bonded with, I looked forward to hanging out with her when I came home, they both gave me a reason to wake up, they made me happy. Now I don't know what to, I have tubs of food left for her that my cat won't eat, I feel so sad every time I look out my window and she's not there waiting. I hate feeling shitty everyday. I just wish I was never born, there's no point in living but I just can't bring myself to go through with it. I've felt like this since I was a kid and it sucks, I hate forcing myself to live.

139866,"I'm stuck and I don't know what to doHi!

I don't really know what the norm is for this subreddit, but I really need to let my thoughts out, and someone to talk to if possible, so I'll just spill my guts.Hopefully I have the right place to post it.

I'm not currently seeing a therapist/ counselor, although I'm working on getting one. I have seen one a few times about a year ago, and initially they wanted to prescribe me medication, but I was worried about taking such a serious drug. I don't know if I have depression or anxiety or am just going through a hard time, although I feel like I have anxiety and am going through a spout of situational depression. Maybe this isn't what I'm supposed to be talking about.

Basically, all of this stems from a relationship. It sounds dumb, but I guess everyone has they're own issues and I shouldn't belittle how I feel. A brief summary, this was my first relationship through our teenage years, and I was/ still am very in love with him. We have a very deep connection. I am not very good at making friends/ have always been shy and had low self-confidence, but he has been the person I've been the absolute closest with. Our relationship really ended because of long distance, and we both acknowledge that now is not the time for us to date and have agreed not to speak to one another in the hopes that someday in the future, when we are happier and healthier, we might naturally come together again to be friends or whatever we choose. But you can imagine how hard it is if your best friend/ family leaves you. It felt like how it would feel if my mother left me.

I was very dependent on him, and at first, couldn't imagine a future without him. Now, I'm seeing that that possibility is becoming stronger and stronger which I've accepted on some level. This has all been going on for months and months and I just can't get over it. I've cut him out of my life, deleting him from all social media and not speaking to him, but I did see him about a month ago to resolve some things. In all of these months of not speaking to him, I've gained the ability to be more independent, make new friends, not rely on him, but I still feel like there is a huge hole in my heart. In ways, it feels like I've made no progress at all. I still think about him all the time and get just as upset as I did a few months ago. In the end, he was a jerk to me, and in all honesty, I don't know why I love him, but I still do. 

I'm not planning anything seriously, but as of this moment, the only solutions I can see to this are suicide or, possibly, moving away. I don't live where he lives but I still feel so connected to him as all of the people in my circle of friends are friends with him and still interact with him. It hurts to know that he is still out there and vaguely know what he is doing, if that makes sense? I don't know if moving away and leaving all of my friends behind is what I need to do or will only make me more lonely. It seems so fucking dramatic to kill myself over some guy, but the pain is so bad.

FUCK I just feel like an immature dip-shit for thinking all of these things, but I just don't know what else to do. I don't know how to just move on or let things go. I'm not looking for relationship advice. I know the right thing to do is not to speak to him, but I just feel so shitty and don't know how to feel less so, other than the two options listed above. please help :/",depression

301931,"I am Worthless..Well how can I put it? I feel I've been given this life without a choice. 
I was never truly meant to be born into this world and now I have to drag my feet through it all. 

at the age of 22 I've been ""you're too young to even think those sort of ways"" ""Life is too precious to give up"" ""You're still young, you can do it"" But are those words true and genuine? 

I'm Mentally/Emotionally and of somewhat physically disabled. I was 18 years old when my mother left me. I didn't have anyone to lean on after that, yes I do have my step father and my half sister and not to mention the rest of my family to give me support but I can only take so much of this internal pain I have.

I was given government money for my disabilities or other known as ""SSDI"" or Social Security Disability Income. I was young and naive and wasn't sat down and told what I should really do with it. after the course of years being able to have that to help me, Social security took it and told me I have ""lack of documents for my disabilites"" I have documents that date back in 1996.

There have been places I've been sent to for professional help and facilities that have a group of people who have similar problems, I've been sent there many times from the age of 13 years old to 16 years old at those times, 
Due to being sent to a place called 'Pine Rest' was because I was always suicidal and evaluated me there as a in-patient. after all that.. I'm still the same way as I was when I was younger.

I have Major Depression, High anxiety, Very claustrophobic, panic attacks, ASD ""Autistic spectrum disorder"", Functional Limb Weakness, Suicidal thoughts, black outs, Cognitive Impairment, those are some of the things I suffer from.

I've had Cancer and 2 strokes when I was a baby. I've gone through chemotherapy and radiation. Those factors make a huge toll on you and it can affect your life drastically.

I've graduated from high school but I don't have a diploma, but a Certificate of Completion.. and with having that I can't get into any college... I've tried going for a GED but I was scored ""under average"" and they took about over $200 of my money as well..

Social security sends me countless notices that I have to pay $12,000 dollars, in which I do not have at all. I even struggle with trying to find a job to pay that..

I've done over 90 applications and I've only gotten 1 interview. I've been having major depression over this and I've been trying to file for an appeal for SSDI back. I've learned of my mistakes back then and I want to be able to support myself properly..

I've been thinking about making a waiver for the money I don't have but I'm scared that they will decline my waiver and yet they think I can work a full-time, 7 days a week job. I can't because I suffer from a lot of my limitations. I can only do maybe 2 days out of a week and 4-5 hours of work for those 2 days.

I just don't know what to do.. I'm disabled and I can't even find a job, being a young person and dealing with all this on my shoulders really hurts me especially mentally. 

It's hard for young people to find a job, it's even harder for people like myself to get a job and I'm left with nothing truly...

I just want my life to end, I feel worthless, a dead beat to society,
a helpless nobody, Someone with no value at all to life, waste of life and blood, a mockery to the human race.. I can't deal with this and I'm struggling so much and with no money coming in.. I just feel if I take my life, I won't have to suffer through this. It's better to end your life because it's more easier but to live your life everyday is painful and miserable.

I've been starving myself for the past few weeks, with only eating little by having some dinner and that's all because of my depression sinks into my head and with only dark clouds of negativity. I've lost my appetite due to it and I'm wasting away..

I want nothing more than my life to be ended so I can feel at peace and be with my mother again. She was the only one who truly known who I was and what I've gone through because. She's my mom and without her I can't go on anymore..

I've tried to kill myself countless times but that was when I was younger and I didn't get a %100 success rate due to failing or my mom/dad stopping it..

The suicidal/self harm things I've done to myself were.. Burn my skin, Overdose on pain killers, tried to hang myself, tried to drink cyanide, Cut my wrist, swallow foreign objects, tried to jump off buildings.. those are but  few I've attempted to do..

I just want to die.. I'm worthless..",depression

Here’s a little back ground, I had a boyfriend last year in college. We started out as drinking buddies but it eventually led to more. We developed a very close relationship as he was there for me when my father died. We spent every day for months together until I decided to drop out. I started dating a new guy not to long after I left. College boyfriend would still try to snap chat me every once in a while but I would usually ignore them since my current boyfriend wouldn’t feel comfortable with me talking to him. Well he hasn’t snap chatted me in a while but I didn’t think much of it. Side note: He is actually from the town over from where I live now. Only about 20min away and are towns are so small everyone knows everyone. 

I work at the convenience store in town and his brother walked in. After his brother left I was talking to my co worker about it and explained I used to date his brother and how we where really close. She knew exactly how  was talking about and got real quiet. She told me he killed himself a few months ago. I looked up his obituary to make sure it’s true and sure enough it is. The last snap chat I got from him was November 12th and I ignored it. He passed November 12th. I know it’s not my fault. He didn’t say anything but “hi” but somehow I still fell like I could have stopped it if I just responded maybe he would have told me how he was feeling and I could have helped.

For their entire lives, everyone has a choice. To keep on doing what you're doing, or to stop. To take the next step, or to stand still. To live, or to die. Most people aren't aware of the choice, because they don’t even see the latter as an option. It was the same for me. But the scales have been tipping for a long time now, and now they’ve tipped all the way. Sure, it might be “the shallowest thing you’ve ever heard”, but not for me. I’m not made for this world. To survive, in a world like this, I’d need to fundamentally reshape who I am, but I can’t change. I won’t, I don’t want to change. So this is really the only way to stop living like this. 

So, It’s decided. I’ll kill myself. Before that though, I need to get used to the fact that I’m gonna die. I’m not yet sure how I’m gonna do it, probably jump. It’s fast and easy. I was thinking of ODing on pills, but I don’t want to survive and have my brain be fucked. 

I don’t want to die, I want to see TES6, to go to Japan, hear the new Area 11 album. Get a girlfriend. But just like I’ve gotten used to the fact that I’ll never have friends; never meet someone who loves me not because they have to, ill get used to the rest as well. August, probably.

My isolation has reached it's breaking point. I don't think I can live in a world where I'm so different from every single person around me. So unfit and tossed aside. So resentful. It seems a bit like a war. Like a race. Them vs me.

It's almost always been this way. I've never seen it different.

Just to be clear, I don't think having someone to talk is going to help me, but it's more so dealing with the feeling of how different and unlikable I am. Furthermore, talking to someone who has all the things above really ruins the relationship between us, due to resentment. Anyways, I don't really see a path.

331622,"FriendsAll of my friends including me are all suicidal and depressed. It fucking hurts to see them go down spiraling into self hatred and further pushing others down a collison course to out other friends. It fucking hurts to see the people you care about get treated like abysmal garbage and are hurt, beaten and physical and verbal abuse. It most definitely fucking hurts to have your best friend completely back stab you and try to ruin your relationships and reputation. 

I was fucking with you through thick and thin and this is how you fucking pay me back. I was with you when everyone was against you, when you were at your witts' end helping you through a metric fuck ton of problems. Now I hate your guts more than anything in this god forsaken planet. I remember a time when I still cared for you. I cant believe you would fucking do this. More than 7 times have I stuck with you through every one of your problems and breakdowns. When you had the smallest, little inkling of a problem. When it wasnt even a fucking problem you fucking dramatic bitch. I helped you. You said you would change time and time again, with your half-assed apologies and fake as fuck tears. I used to be really happy with you and all that wholesome shit. A few months ago it just got too fucking hard for my little fucking mind to handle. I gave you one last chance to finally better yourself and you squandered it. 

Tiresome 
It got so fucking tiring and annoying to here your whore mouth yap on and on. You were toxic and irritating. You could fix those 'problems' in 5 fucking seconds if you actually put your mind to it. Chance and chance again I yearned for breaking things off. But everyone else were still hopeful for change. They were wrong.

Peace
I was so relieved when you said to me those magical words ""goodbye"". It felt like an abysmally large weight was lifted from my chest. No more drama, no more fights. Just peace. It was hard with our other friends not wanting to break it off. For those few last months I yearned for you to slip up one more time. So I could show you how much of a horrible person you were being. Childish, fucking retarded, idiotic, prideful, weak, scared and an asshole. I almost fucking killed you. Be grateful for our friends being more than generous and helpful. I urged them to get out like I did. But their compassion over powered their common sense. They were so commendable yet fucking idiotic. 

You hurt us a lot and yet they still care for you.

Get this, the reason for my suicide attempts is because I am a failure. It's pretty funny. Anyway, I still have suicidal thoughts. Haven't acted on them for a while, a year maybe. But lately for the first time I've been seeing a therapist and so far it's not helping at all. It's been 3 months. Granted that's a short period of time. But to not work at all? I'm not made of money. Neither are my parents(i live at home).

Ok, maybe i should elaborate about what depresses the hell out of me. I have social anxiety and a learning disability. I knew i had one but about a month ago I started to look up what ""Title 1"" is. Now i was in title 1 for a long time, through middle school. So thats a big chunk of my depression.. I mean what is there to do with my life? I try my ABSOLUTE hardest in school and i manage to get 60-70%?! I don't want to be working at some call center or mcdonalds for the rest of my life. Which at this point would be good just to get some money but I'm too scared to go to the interview!

I was bullied in high school because i was.. well.. i guess annoying. My friends stopped talking to me because this bully told them i was annoying and how stupid/gay I was. So then all this lead to everyone calling me gay and occasionally hitting me. It didn't hurt me a lot being called gay but after a while it just got to me. And i was a freshmen at this point, so of course it would get to me.

I've talked with family members and co-workers about my feelings of depression and event thoughts of suicide. They've been comforting in the moment but I realize it feels shallow to me. It's not that I want people to put down everything and dedicate themselves to making me feel better or anything like that.

I guess have this nagging feeling that I should kill myself and no one seems that interested in helping me find a way to deal with it. I've had heart to hearts and discussions about ""how to fix my problems"" but its hard to fix my problems on my own. Ive managed to get a lot done while crying about it the whole time, sure. But I feel like living is very inconvenient and if I'm not constantly distracted or occupied by something then I feel absolutely hopeless and miserable and lonely.

I've been thinking about killing myself so I can give my money to my family and I dont want people to start caring and hurting after I'm dead lol but that's been one factor that's been holding me back. 

My boyfriend is the only person I've told about my plan and he obviously doesn't want me to and I appreciate the thought of course. I just know the money will help everyone more than I ever could and I'd want a natural burial so it shouldnt cost much to throw my corpse in the ground. 

I dont want him to be sad. I really dont but we live in different countries and we don't make enough money to visit eachother regularly. Its so hard to take the steps to get the paper work done so we can live together. I think itd be a lot easier on him if he had someone wealthier or even in the same country to be with. I have friends that don't I talk to (thats my fault for not keeping in touch) and family that ive tried reaching out to, but everyone has their own problems you know.

He has been in multiple relationships during his depression and suicidal periods, and recently ended one.

Anyway I finally came here for help because I got a text.

""RutabagaSchmidt, I like you.  You're a nice guy and only person really trying. So I'll give you a heads up.

I'm 18, have no job, no girlfriend, no real friends, nothing except writing and my computer. All I do is just eat my family's food, use their electricity, and just leech off them. Every day is exactly the same as the last. Wake up, play games, eat, go to sleep. I don't want to go outside at all. There's nothing that interests me outside. I just wanna go to sleep and die.

I have nightmares all the time, each one vivid and frightening. I wake up screaming from them sometimes. I have severe depression, and i'm worried that soon I might become a schizo because my father was one. He's also a deadbeat druggie like me, though i'm not as bad as him, yet. I'd at least like to kick his ass before I die to thank him for being such a good father and leaving me and my mom when I was a baby.

Also, no woman alive wants me, I mean I understand, i'm a worthless mess. I guess they can smell the loser past the perfume. I like to think I do a good job of hiding how dysfunctional I am. Most people think i'm distant, and I like it that way. The less they know, the better.

Another thing that bothers me is how much of a waste of space I am. Me killing myself would be a blessing to my family. My mom can barely afford her own meds for her diabetes, and then she has to buy mine as well. I feel so bad that she has to pay for them, but I can't find a job anywhere to help her.  Whenever I don't take my meds I can barely get out of bed.

A few months ago I visited my parents to another city. My relationship with them is complicated and the main source of my mental issues. I had a huge argument with them and just wanted to get out. Problem: It was late at night and I had no way to come back home, I don't know their city but I know they don't live in a nice area, so I did not dared to just walk the night out, and hotels were not an option. 

I felt as I was trapped, the previous argument had messed me bad inside, so as soon as they got out of the room I tried to jump through the window of a sixth floor. I couldn't make it because my SO was there and browled me to the ground until I came back to my senses.

I've harmed myself in the past, but this was my first attempt. When I self-harmed I always had the feeling that it was not right, that it was not something normal people do, that there were other options other than self-harming. I always thought if I tried to commit suicide, the feeling would be simmilar, maybe stronger, but it was not. 

As I was trying to pull myself out, it felt... normal, like it was the logical thing to do, like being alive was unreasonable. I didn't feel sad, I didn't feel angry, I didn't even feel empty, I just felt like I was completing a task, nothing that special. And that feeling of ""normality"", of feeling everything was okay and I just had to jump because it was the logical thing to do, has haunted me since then. I'm afraid, if I have another break down like that and there's nobody who can stop me, I'll end it. 

I tried talking about this with my psychiatrist and with my psychologist, but since it was a situational one time thing they just brushed it off. I'd love if someone could explain me what happened and if they've ever felt the same. Thank you.",depression

295702,"Failing Highschool, want to kill myselfI've been an honour student since I was in grade 7, I'm currently in grade 11. 
I've been to over 8 schools and moved over 9 times. I never stay in a house for more than 3 years, as soon as 2 years pass my family moves to a new location. It's hard to make friends, why make them when I'm gonna move again. My mom literally came into my room one day and said we're moving. My dad left when I was in kindergarten, never seen him since, hes running from the cops.

Last year was my failure year, first semester I got honours like always. Second semester is when it all went down hill.
I transfered to a completely new district. My mother transfered me into the school a week before it started. I had to sign up for classes I didn't want to be in since the classes I wanted were full. The highschool I was supposed to go to had me signed up for AP-1 classes, which were the art kids who were very smart. This school had me in Math 10-3 which were the slower kids, I completely died in that class. My schopl is filled with fithy rich drugged out white kids. Me coming from an Asian family, completely hated it, I didn't fit in. 

That whole year I had made no friends. Second semester for Science 10-2, I had this new Caucasian teacher who completely hated my guts. My mother decided it would be a great idea to go on vacation a week before we had our summer break, because of it I had to hand in around 9 assignments in one week. I was panicking. I did it all thankfully but it really killed me. The whole 1 week vacation I was in panic. The science teacher gave me no notes to study on, I had no friends in that class who would help me and I was surrounded by classmates who a copied off 1 person. The teacher would make jokes like mimicking Donald Trump and saying racist things. She made a joke and said ""See, all the white kids are laughing"" and looked directly at me. She'd always forget I'm in class and would mark me absent, she'd never give me the assignments so literally everyday I would have to go up to her desk and ask for it. EVERY DAY. She'd give out tons of home work and I'd fail all of it, when I asked for help they would always be half ass answers. She'd always talk about her boyfriend and forget how to do something we're learning so students would always correct her. She failed me. I got a 43 and needed a 50 to pass. 

(Longer story)-this year:skip;;; They put me in Science 20-2, my grades went from being a 43 last year to being in the 90 marks. This teacher was amazing. Suddenly they kicked me out of this class, put me in learning support, I'm a good student, I had no homework, I sat in that class doing nothing. Counsiler does not like me at all. This school offers no support.

 I think I had about 18 credits last year. Very low, I asked for online courses, summer school, extra credits but the counsiler, like I said, hates me and said no to everything. My mom wants me to take more Science classes, so I will have 3 cores next semester, Sci-10 Eng-2 Social-2. Next year Sci-20 and Sci-30. I don't need science 30 to graduate but shes forcing me. first semester is almost over... I had a huge mental breakdown last year, I don't cry in front of people but I started crying in my room and my mom came running, you'd think shes there to help right? No. She yelled at me, screamed, threw things at me, said things like "" Why the fuck are you crying? HUH??!! Answer me, look at me, what the fuck is your problem!"" She threw a phone charger at me. I have younger sibling 13 &amp; 11. They steal, swear, lie ALL the time. Theres sooo much more drama to tell you all. 
I've been depressed for so long, so many years have gone by without killing myself. I can't do these fake smiles anymore

Theres absolutely no way I'll get enough credits to graduate, I want to drop out and just end it all. I don't care anymore, it's almost 3AM right now, I can't sleep, all I can think about is killing myself. I'm ready to die.",depression

Back then, I had dreams about having an illness that was slowly killing me and I would lie in my bed and think about who would be with me in my final hours. I also tried to think of an answer for what is beyond death. Am I reborn, will I wander the earth like a ghost, or would I be dust in the galaxy? It always circled my mind, even today
I was never really social in school. No one really liked me, I cant explain why. I wasnt weird from what I can remember, I never had the ambitions to make friends. A few kids invited me to their group and thats how I made it through preschool. The next years I was on my own again because I couldn't go to the same school as my friends, and my new class was full of kids who lived in the same villages and did preschool together. Again I wouldn't socialize, I was bullied and even physically attacked, but the teachers never saw it and they didnt understand why I wanted to be alone. After 2 years I told my parents I wanted to change schools, they didnt knew about the bullying but they signed me into another school
I made it through graduation, was rather bad because I couldn't get my lazy self to study
I tried university for 2 years, even made a few friends by myself, but since I left there because I couldn't graduate the classes, I slowly lost my friends. The only one staying with me was my best friend, but she recently moved to Britain and I know that our friendship cant last through this
I may have depression, I never talked to a doctor about it but its the only reasonable excuse why I feel down all day. I had two suicide attempts within half a year and it broke me even more that I wouldn't die already.

But after all I've read in this reddit, it feels ""unfair"" that I want to kill myself when there are people with much worse situations. I have no diseases, I have a somewhat working family and a few friends, I make some money without graduation and I'm not in debt. But I just want to die.

295294,"My ""friends"" don't give a fuck about meIt seems that lately, I've been dropping hints because I want to know that more than one person will care when I die.. not exactly because it will change my mind because my mind is set but because I want to know that I'm not completely alone in my death. But I've come to the realization that it's only my dad that will give a fuck or two, and as glad as I am that I have him, it's really depressing that I spend every day with two people that honestly don't mind pretending that everything is fine. Not that anyone actually cares, but I've come across a painless way to commit suicide and I'm so ready to get it over with but I'm caught on causing my dad so much pain. He's really the only reason I haven't yet and I'm scared to tell anyone in fear that someone will try to tell me they care so I don't do it
Nobody understands that it's a done deal already, I'm just waiting for the right time but how could I ask anyone to understand... I mean, it's not like they care if I go or not, it's just that they don't want to have to deal with it. Whether they were my ""friend"" or not. 
I say ""friend"" lightly because, really, I don't have any friends. I have two people that I spend most of my time with just to be depressed in someone's company. They don't try to help, they don't want to see me smile, they're just sick of dealing with me. I get it. It's a lot to handle when you have negative energy around all the time. I know, I know. You don't have to tell me. But it's the obvious truth. I'm only there so they're not alone. I just think they're gonna have to get used to it. I won't be around much longer. I don't know when I'm gonna do it.. I've told myself that I'm going to wait until my dad dies just so he doesn't have to try to cope with my suicide but at this point, I'm at a loss.

111463,"Idk if I'm in love Hi, I've found this sub about 5 minutes ago and scrolling the various topic, seems like is the right place to solve my doubts.

I start saying that English is not my first language, so I probably did some mistakes.

I don't understand if I'm in love with my best friend and if she is interested in me.
We know each other since primary school and this year we finished high school. For some reasons we end up going to the same university.
We get along very well, we have no problem sleeping in the same bed, stay close, passing entire afternoon together, etc... things that two best friends do.

The problems started this summer, me and her were bored because we were on holiday with our parents and we started chatting and calling at the phone almost every day. When we met I started creating occasion to be alone with her but my friends are stupid and didn't leave me alone. Finally, some days ago I helped her for the an exam but I came out from her house more confused than before.

During past years I had my experiences and I know how does it fell being in love but this time I'm not sure if it's the same feeling.
Another thing that confuses me are our (female) friends. They sometimes started saying why we two don't start dating and they look at me as I should understand something. (This is my thought, I'm not sure)
She is quite shy, especially with guys, so she probably wouldn't do the first move, but I'm afraid to do it beacuse I don't really know what I feel and I've always considered her more like a little sister (despite she is older than me).
 
Hope you guys can give me some good advices.
Thanks in advance.",non-depression

i have heroin addiction and somedays im really fucked up so in the past 5 months i've had to ignore her for like 4-5 days and this happened 6 times.
Its always her who calls me, mostly after 2 a.m. cause i have sleeping problems and she has a fucked up sleep cycle 'cause of quarantine. 
Last time she we talked she emphasized the fact that she has to call everytime and said she wont be calling anymore and i will have to call her 

How do i tell her i'm too shy to even call her??

And what if she said she'd stop calling cause she got bored of me knowing the fact that i wont call. It seems like an easy escape off me. 
Even so i called her around not our usual time 7:00 p.m. she has'nt called back in two days
No texts on instagram but i know she's inactive on instagram
I sent her test related material on whatsapp, she received  it but hasn't read yet. 
1. Is she ignoring  me at all or she's just busy?? 
2. Is she ignoring  me cause she got bored and lost interest 
3. Is she ignoring  me cause she needs time to herself (maybe im too much to handle)
4. Is she ignoring  me to test me how much i care about her??  If thats the case what should i do?? I dont want to look needy 
5. Maybe she's not ignoring  me and something bad must have happened  cause her parents  are strict and she saved my contact info as LOVE(with 2 red hearts) its our inside joke that she calls me love and i do the same. Maaybe her parents saw a missed call from LOVE(with 2 red hearts) and confiscated her phone.

So the real question  is that what she wants??
She wants me to call her?? Or she wants my miserable existence(with 2 red hearts) out of her life 

Feels like i've already been friend-zoned and have no chances but i'm helpless here.

1. Start out with an Instagram “Ask me anything” on your story. 

2. Ask yourself the question “who do you like?” And respond to that with “I’ll dm you the answer” and do that about 2 times

3. Now hopefully, others will be asking you now and always answer with “Dm me and I’ll tell you” 
Make sure to tell them the truth

He has battled with mental health his entire life and has obsessed over death. He said he was going to get in a car and drive around five hours to my younger brother and mother to do it in front of them so that he could be surrounded by people he loves.  

I think there is a time and place for physician assisted suicide, but this is not it. He does not have a terminal illness. 

As a family member, this is just unreal and unfathomable.....he said if he couldn’t get to my brother and mom (he was under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol) that he would drive to a Walmart parking lot and blow his head off.  I feel as though I could handle if this happens (as horrible as it sounds) but my mom and brother would lose it.

223399,"I’m so tiredThere is a typical confusion about depression, which generally does not allow you to understand the problem. So you live, every day, bad, you think it’s the place, your life, people around you. But you’re sick and this kills you slowly. 

I never understood the root of my problems, I always thought it was loneliness, but I’ve always had so many people around, and in my native country so many dear friends who over the years has done more and more close to me. So what? 

With time, I started to isolate myself, I avoid going out almost always. I don’t take opportunities to find new friends, the only time I go out is to get laid. The last time I went out with someone was two weeks ago to fuck a girl known on Tinder. Actually we didn’t fucked, she talked about shoes all the eve. 

I can’t enjoy hanging out with anyone anymore, because stay with people makes me just more depressed. I don’t know what to say, I don’t know what to talk about. My sadness, my need for isolation, and all the responsibilities I have are killing me. I can’t handle this.

I am finally full-on crying as I type this after months of three of four tears coming out. It feels nice. 

I'm making the least money I've made in years. I am barely scraping by. It is hard for me to afford to eat; I have one meal a day, sometimes one meal every two days.

I don’t think I want to wait for a potential way with technological and scientific advances. This will definitely sound crazy to some or even many, I believe I’ve experienced a lot of past lives.

I’m one of the most logical minded skeptical people you’ll meet and of course I’ve got all of this crazy stuff. But experiences and feelings sometimes can’t be explained with logic.

328956,"This ever present suicidal ideation is a constant weight on my shoulders. Help isn't coming quick enough just because i don't really want to die...I don't take any depression medication or anything like that so that might be partly to blame but still even if i went to my GP and got suitable antidepressants for suicidal ideation then what? I have to embrace that unfamiliar path rather than my already very familiar path of half and half suicidal ideation? Half passive suicidal thoughts and half intense almost active suicidal thoughts? I am tired right now and yet this is when it is all at a manageable enough level with the passive suicidal thoughts and the depressive mood...

I just don't know what i want guys in anything in my current life really. I sorta feel like i am stuck in the middle seeking help as i never feel very ready for change due to various reasons such as my autism and when i seek what i am comfortable with, i can't seen to get it before i deteriorate and i am back at square one...

Everything i do different from what i usually do hardly ever works out so will antidepressants really be an assistance to me in this crap? Sometimes i feel i am much too weird for mood stabilising things (i think antidepressants are seen as mood stabilisers but i might be wrong :P) to be helpful even if i find the right one/s for me.

A big part of me wants to wait for an assessment session from one of the 2 talking therapy waiting lists i am on before i try out antidepressants but then that same part of me feels like its my fault i keep feeling this way since i don't take what is offered to me (in this case drugs).

182431,"A Review Of The Celebrations Box Of Chocolates One of the neighbours gave us a box of Celebrations as a Christmas present. My parents aren't big on chocolate so I got to eat them. For a bit of fun, I decided to write what I thought about all of them. In order of worst to best, here's my list and what I thought of each chocolate:

Mars - My dad really likes to get these off-brand Mars bars, so that's definitely made my taste-buds go a little blind to it's flavour, but even if he never discovered those, I don't think I'd enjoy this much more.

The taste is... bland. Really bland. The nougat and caramel relationship is one of a power imbalance. The nougat takes everything that the caramel holds dear and makes it about itself. As for the texture, it does the same. A really soft and sickly thing that just sticks to your teeth and becomes a bit of a nightmare. Real shame that it's easily the most common one in the box. In fact, that probably weakens it's case, because you might try to find some different flavours, like a Galaxy or a Maltesers, but you'll just find Mars, which pisses you off even more about them.

Milky Way - Not much different from the Mars bar, except creamier, which makes the texture much easier to take because of how less sweet it is. The lack of caramel is responsible for this, I'm guessing. Also very common.

Bounty - this is the most divisive one in the entire box. Some people get grossed out by the coconut, some people love it. I enjoy it, mainly because it's such a nice breath of fresh air. Enjoy in moderation, since it can get boring after 3-in-a-row. Nice texture, ok taste. Would rank higher if it wasn't for how much hate it gets.

Twix - I'm rewriting this because I completely forgot that this was even in the box. I enjoy a biscuit-chocolate combo, as somebody with an addiction to Tesco-brand chocolate digestives, but you won't even remember having this in your pocket. It doesn't help that there's only a handful in the box.

Galaxy (Normal) - Very forgettable. Just a block of chocolate. But for what it is, it's executed really well. Melts in your mouth. Boring concept, great execution. Rounds it to an average selection.

The final 3 are the 3 in the box that I love, head and shoulders, above the rest. The ones that you search for, the ones that make your heart drop when you can't find any, the ones that taste... divine.

Galaxy (Caramel) - I did a poll of this on my Instagram, and this flavour got a lot of hate. I was really surprised, because I love this one. I'm a simp for caramel, so it does make sense, but when you combine that with galaxy chocolate (which I stated above is done excellently), it makes a Dragonball fusion of great stuff. 

Snickers - I. Love. Snickers. The toughness of the texture, the nuts, how many there are in the box. It's amazing. Great stuff. I love eating nuts in many ways ( ;);) ), but Snickers is one of my favourite.

And now, for what is EASILY the best chocolate in the entire box.

Maltesers - Give the absolute MADLAD who decided to put these in the box a promotion. Hell, make him the goddamn chairman of chocolate, because he deserves it.

Won without breaking a SWEAT on the poll, it's absolutely brilliant. The malt and chocolate marriage is so brilliant that they have 3 loving kids, they live in a good neighbourhood, where the malt goes off to do yoga in the mornings and the chocolate has the most cushy job in existance. That crunch is so damn *satisfying* that it will change you life just by experiencing this #MASTERPIECE.

As for the rarity, every time you see this in a box, it's like a Bigfoot sighting. Because along with the fact that there's only 4 or 5 in the entire box, everybody else who had a pick before you will most likely take them first, but that just makes the occasional discovery of these things all the sweeter. It's like winning a lottery of chocolate, the modern day golden ticket, except I'd take a box of these things over that tax-evading slave-owning douchebag's factory any day of the week.

To sign off, Maltesers rule, Mars' drool, and see ya.",non-depression

I have closed myself to the outer world completely, cut off social media, only coming out when the delivery guy is here for my meal every other day to sustain myself. I have being smoking weed in the dark of my tiny room for the past year, because it's the only way to numb my brain so I can stop thinking about shooting a bullet through my fucking skull.

Everyone I have ever cared about is gone, because they were also tired of this shit, they have been beaten to their death by this fucked up life.

Every night when I sleep, when I am actually able to sleep, I hope, even pray, that I will not wake up in the morning.

This has to end somehow, someway. And I think the only way is to kill myself. Thank whatever the fuck controls this universe that no one left cares about me, so I won't hurt anyone when it's done.

68506,"The Only Way Out...Before I start I want everyone to know this is not a call for attention. I want help but I've given up.. So here it is. 

I'm a 27 year old male. And my life has been one constant disappointment and failure. I have had short periods of happiness and success, I almost had a baby girl.. However even that was selfishly taken from me. Now-a-days I spend my time alone with my dog, when I'm not being verbally abused by my mother and sister or being physically abused by my brother I hide in my room with him. It is the only place I feel truly safe. I've struggled with drug addiction since I was 18, from pills to IV Heroin use.. To everything and anything else you can imagine... That lead to 8 years of my life spent in and out of institutions, forced away from my family by my mother at 18 when I came to her asking for help with my abuse of opiod pills, instead of helping me she threw me away to rot in rehabs in and out, whilst my brother whom is 3 and 1/2 years older than me got to stay at home in the loving and comfortable embrace of my mother and smoke his meth. He was always very abusive, to the point of putting his hands on my mother, yet she still holds him in a higher standing than myself. I am a simple doormat. My sister disregards me as a person, to her I am more of a walking waste of space who deserves nothing less than complete and total verbal demoralizaton... She's 1 and 1/2 years younger than myself. Than there is my mother... She wasn't always like this, shames me when I cry, minimalizes every emotion I have by scoffing or acting disgusted that her 27 year old man of a son would even show such weakness.. It kills me when she does this... Yet I still continue to try and please her every demand whether it be clean the house or do her errands. I am but a yes man to a house of bullies. She wasn't always like this, I don't remember my childhood.. Repressed due to the actions of a verbally abusive father to which I got the worst of. I wasn't the son he wanted, I was weak. I didn't like fighting or other ""manly"" activities like my brother did.. Although I did enjoy camping, the beauty, peace, and freedom of nature was the only reason I truly survived my childhood. My mother stood up for me whenever he would get out of hand with his words, finally at age 11 they divorced and we were finally free. But during those years I was my mother's comforting ear and safety, she slept in my room to avoid him for years, nothing sexual just safety. We supported each other became codependent on each other and it worked. When I was forced into rehab with the ultimatum of ""if you don't go you will be cut off from the family"" I couldn't bear the thought of losing my mother so I went. This was the beginning of the end. The rehabs would lie and make my mother feel as if it was her fault I was the way I am and over time our connection disappeared... To the point of now she can barely stand the sight of me.. My brother beat me two weeks ago, she said she wished he would have put me in the hospital so I would ""really have something to cry about"" I've developed PTSD, whenever I hear my brothers jingling keys enter the house I lock up and shake and feel as if the air that I breath has disappeared from the room.. I am now inable to work, I don't trust anybody... I met a girl, the first real relationship I've ever had! It was amazing my relationship with my mother returned, my sister loved me again and my brother treated me like a brother... Well nothing good lasts for me. At five months pregnant upon waking up from a nap at 25 years old the girl came to me almost immediately with an odd smirk on her face and stated ""I'm aborting the baby... And we are breaking up"" my heart sank and I sobbed... I relapsed that day on alcohol.. That run lasted a year. When I came out of it I wasn't the same. My family was worse, (small detail whenever I was not in rehab I maintained a job, until I inevitably relapsed and was sent back. However for the past seven years my brother has been using non stop and has never even been kicked out of the house from his behavior, also hasn't had a job for six years straight. Yet im told every minute of every day if I don't get a job I will be out on the street) I am sober now. I just can't do it anymore, I'm empty inside I have no want or drive to do anything. I'm waiting until my next refill of medications next month and I will be moving on to the next plane of existence. I've stated to my family and all my mother has to say is ""just do it already, don't threaten me"" when it's not a threat it's a cry for help! She's a nurse for christ sake.. No compassion nor empath from anyone in my family.. A family that used to be so close... I guess this is my statement? In 16 days I will no longer be breathing. I will just be an empty Vessel... I mean you could say that's what I am right now... The only thing that has stopped me is my dog.. I rescued him but as much as I love him it is no longer enough to match the pain I feel. I'm a 27 year old male, I've tried everything to make my life liveable... And it's not possible. Goodbye dear world.. If my family ever reads this, I want you all to know that I told you this would happen and you all laughed and continued to abuse me. I can't go on any longer being afraid, my PTSD going untreated. The disgusted looks when I can't control my emotions. I'm driven to this... Farewell... May the next plane be free of pain...",depression

Im fricking lazy when it come to work and learning, physical thing like going on a walk, doing dishes and other basic stuff i have a better time doing but work.

Yesterday i was going to do 1 piece of work and i didnt do it, like come on, it would just take 1 hour, you shouldn't just put it off FOR A WEEK.


This is why ill be a failure because you need to do stuff to not be lazy but you're lazy so you dont want to do stuff and ill have to keep on doing stuff just so i dont fear becoming lazy again and all that.

I wish i was just a normal kid but nah why dont i just have so many flaw that i want to fix and then have a big ambition that i want to do before im 30 so yeah let just make it where ill hate myself forever and possibly not want to live anymore for the sake that life is too damn hard and that I'd rather take the easy way out because im lazy.

246984,"I’m terrible at literally everythingThere’s no reason for me to be alive. I’m complete garbage at anything I try to do. I suck at talking to people, doing good in school, and even playing video games online. I used to really enjoy playing games on my computer. I no longer enjoy playing them now. It feels mentally draining to play them. Even when I try my best, I’m still shit at them and I’m even told so by others online. I just watch videos on youtube now and occasionally play a game on my phone or something to distract myself from wanting to die every second of the day. 

I really wish that I was someone else. I can’t ever do anything right and I disappoint so many people. I’m easily replaceable. If I’m ever gone, there will always be someone that can do what I do much better than I can. If only there was a painless suicide method

346578,"Hi Reddit, made a throwaway to vent my story. Anna Karenina says it all. So, I'm a redditor for a few years now, this is my first ""throwaway"" account. My story is similar to Anna's if you know the Tolstoy novel. I haven't read the novel, though, just the latest movie. But I'm a big Tolstoy fan and have read much of his work.

Anyhow. I'm 35. My husband is 50. My ..what do you call one you are having an affair with..? him. he's 38. My husband, we'll call Mr. B. and my other we'll call Dr. X.  I've known Dr X for .. 18yrs, married to Mr B for 10. I have been having an affair for 5 months now, but it took a sudden turn a little over a week ago. 


Dr X livs 4,000 miles away, we haven't seen each other lately since the affair started, so it's emotional, as sexual as you can get at this distance. We're seeing each other in a couple of weeks. 


Dr X called me drunk. It's been a non-emotional thing so far. It's been ""this is just sex b/c we were so hot together 12 yrs ago"" type of thing.. he was my college BF for a very hot summer. But was my Bestie for 8 yrs before that. So we're close, but i've made it clear that this is not emotional. its just sex. i have said that blatently. 

So Dr X, drunk, starts saying why did i leave him? why didn't i wait for him (he went away for a year to scotland for his phd), why didn't i know he wanted me? he made a big mistake, he was scared. but he never said ""love"" except then he said he would very ""lovingly""(that word) kiss me. 


I'm at the point in my marriage that I'm done, but not done, either. And all of this is so confusing that I end up drunk/high and suicidal nightly. Because it's tormenting. Does Dr X love me? Is he in love wiht me? what does that mean?? And if he doesn't, and if ther'es nothing there, I can't live in this marriage and I dont know that I can get out of it. My husband threatens suicide when I've threatened to leave (many times over the years, most recently tonight).


I've had a few shots of vodka, smoked a bunch, and I'm pretty sick on top of being bi polar and on my period. I know I'm not going to kill myself tonight, but I am starting to plan and what's so strange is there's a serenity about it. I've done all I can. I wanted more. But if I can't have more.. and I dont mean Dr X. Dr X is just the promise that this marriage could end, I could possibly get out of it, there could be hope of something more interesting out there for me. I still want to live in Europe for 2years and visit where I grew up. This marriage will never allow me to go home. It wil not allow me to travel, it will not allow me to breathe. I am in a beautiful gilt cage. I am well taken care of, I have all I want, Mr B gives me anything my heart desires and then some. But I can't travel, I can't live where I'd like to live, I can't pursue some of my dreams. Do I give them up? Do I live in this beautiful prison? 


can't stop the spirits when you need to
this life is more than just a read through

I just wanted to vent. But i'll also take advice. Oh and yes, I am in love with Dr X, always have been, when he left me, I got married to leave the state and try to forget him. It didn't work. And here we are. How does he feel? Can anyone tell? and anyone else felt that serenity once you just... totally... give up?

love you reddit

When my mom or my sister has issues, I listen.

When I have problems, one person listens.

I do.

I get dressed, I listen to myself insult my figure, I listen to myself cry as I carve the word fat repeatedly into my thigh. I listen as I cry over the scars on my stomach, that read 'ugly'. I listen to people saying I am ugly, that I look like a child. I listen to my mother say I look pudgy, I listen to my sister complain about how she looks awful, when I listen to everyone talk about how gorgeous she is, and why aren't I like her?

Some days are particularly bad such as yesterday and which push me from thought into minor action - buying pills, looking up the process to get a gun or the best methods of suicide (like I dont already know). I've come to a realization that even though I feel so close to doing it, I am actually quite far from it. All it would take to back me out of it is thinking what my parents would do without their only child, what my future self could accomplish, and how my problems really aren't that large to tackle. 

My biggest issue is my lack of sexual experiences. Sex sex sex is all that runs through most men's heads around my age but for me I stunted. I've always been behind the curve while simultaneously being surrounded by and hearing stories from the top of the top. Its even harder to deal with because on the surface it seems like I could be great at it yet I still flounder. I've generally been apathetic towards the whole thing in the past 2 years but then a day like yesterday will come and knock me out of it hard.

139292,"It’s extremely messed up that you can’t even go to a psych hospital for help with suicidal thoughts without getting a multi-thousand dollar hospital bill.I was in a psych ward once when I was 17. I struggle with suicidal ideation daily. I would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it weren’t for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it. My bill at my psych hospital was about $20,000. All because I wanted to jump off a bridge. You can’t tell anyone that you’re suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital, but you can’t go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner, just making your problems even worse. There’s no good solution. I want to have the right to die. Or at least get free help. The suicidal hotline doesn’t do shit. I want real help. And not to be thrown in a hospital.

110087,"Ending it on my birthdayHi reddit, sorry if this post is going to be long but I want to share my thoughts with someone since I don't have anybody to talk to.

So I'm a soon to be 22 year old male and thinking about commiting suicide on my birthday in November. 

There are many reasons I don't want to live anymore but one of the major ones is that I'm so lonely. I have no friends only acquaintances. I had a really good friend from my childhood but we lost contact over the years. I tried to connect with him again but we've grown apart. 

Another big issue I have is that I'm a virgin and I want a girlfriend but it is impossible. I don't think I'm that ugly, I'm tall (6'5) go to the gym regularly and have a normal face. The only thing that I'm not happy about with my body is that I'm starting to loose a bit of hair and that I have acne scars on my back and shoulders.

Also I have tried online dating and that is just painful. I get a few matches but the girls don't want to talk there. I have also tried doing hobbies to meet girls but it never works. And going out to bars and nightclubs is not really my thing. The times I've been to bars and nightclubs I can't help to notice that it's mostly men there like 70% males and 30% females. 

That's another reason, I don't like the political views my country has because we have been taking in more people than we can handle. I recently saw a report about the gender imbalance caused by immigration. And when I was born females to males was 1:1. Now it is almost 20 % more males than females in my age range. That makes it impossible for me to find a girlfriend because I have to compete with all these extra men. And it makes me so sad to think that I will most likely be alone all my life, so why continue? 

Should I just work my entire life and pay taxes so that other people can be happy together and have a family? I don't want to contribute to that. I work a full-time job and was thinking of maybe try to study next semester to get a better job but I can't see how that will change anything.

I have never met my biological father but I know he's still alive. I was raised by my mother who I hate because she have been sheltering me since I was a kid. And that has led to me being socially awkward and unable to connect with people. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. 

I've made a poor suicide attempt before. But this time I have to end it, at least then I will be successful with one thing.",depression

Dear Alexander,

You were my everything.The reason i woke up most days,the person i talked to the most,who i wanted to text all day and call all night.Most importantly you showed me how to love and what was love.There were so many things that happened but we always came back to each other and grew stronger because of it.Ive never regretted or hated myself so much for letting someone go.Ive never stopped loving you.I miss you everyday theres not a say that goes by that i dont think of you.You were my forever and always.You still are even if we dont talk.I will never love anyone the way i loved you.What we had was so special and amazing id rather die than have never met you because you saved me and kept me alive most days.You made sure i went to bed and that i ate and that i didnt do anything that would put me at risk.You were there for so many anxiety attacks or after my mom hit me or yelled at me.No one has ever been there for me like you were.I was your burrito and you were my dumbass.I love you.I never stopped loving you.I never will stop loving you.You will always have a piece of my heart because its the piece you earned to have.I truly never knew love till i met you.All the calls that lasted for hours,lil naps id take,movie nights,softball practices,stupid pictures wed send each other,making fun of people on google maps,telling you about my day and asking about urs,just seeing you and hearing your voice and laugh.Everything.I dont regret meeting you.Without you i wouldnt be who i am right now.I got so much confidence because of you.I was you girl,baby,burrito anything else youd call me i didnt care as long as i was yours.Im no longer yours and it tears me apart on the inside that im not.Forever and always thats what we would say.Well you will be forever in my heart and always the one i loved most.There is not a word strong enough for how much i miss you.I stayed because i liked talking with you and then i fell in love with you.No one has made me feel how you made me feel.I cant ever say thank you e=nough for everything you did for me.I love you forever and always.Ill never forget every little memory we made.All the stupid inside jokes and that dumbass word niggardly you liked to say so much knowing it pissed me off.I miss joking around with you and calling you a dumbass then doing stupid shit on facetime as you called me an idiot.In those moments i was always the happiest ive ever been.You made me the happiest no one else.Now that your gone its been hard finding someone to fill that hole.I cant say its been easy.No one is as amazing or had the connection we did.I just wish i fought harder for you.I didnt and that is the biggest regret ill ever make.You were so smart and i truly believed you can do anything you want and deserve the fucking best because youve been through shit.I just hope that you can find someone who makes you half as happy as you made me.I will never forget you.I love you alexander forever and always.Im happy i met you and i hope i can find another like you.",non-depression

234652,"Do you think some people are never supposed to exist at all?In terms of eugenics or whatever, I feel that some people, such as myself, were never supposed to exist and would be doing the world a favor if they ended it. For clarification, I was born with a craniofacial anomaly where my skull plates were fused together at birth, otherwise known as Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. As a result, I have slight hearing loss, a small jaw, a horseshoe scar from both sides of my skull and extremely low self-esteem because my face is not perfectly symmetrical. Even if I didn't suffer from clinical depression, I feel that I should never have been born because people with genetic issues are deficient and are not supposed to procreate, for fear of passing on that gene that makes them deficient. 
Furthermore, for over half my life I have felt that I was never supposed to exist and have contemplated suicide since before I was 12 ( I am now a month away from my 24th birthday) and my family is riddled with mental and substance abuse issues on both sides. 
I have no discernible traits or talents aside from my ability to read books and analyze tv. I have attempted to date people from dating apps but I haven't been able to find the right people and I am convinced that if I were to survive another 20 years or so, it will be as a completely single person, possibly with multiple cats. I have had friends in the past, but they have all left me, possibly knowing how crazy and weird I truly am. 

Basically, I have almost always known that I was going to die by my own hand and within the past year have come to terms with the fact that I will end everything after my grandparents pass, which will most likely be in less than five years. This makes sense as they are the only people who have truly been able to care for me as parents should. My biological father has never been able to be there for me and my mother has tried in her own way but sees her children as people who have an obligation to take care of her, and bail her out,  even when she messes up her own life due to the fall out from being addicted to drugs and alcohol for so long.",depression

312148,"Hell is empty and all the devils are hereLife is hell. The devils are all around me. 

I love my family and they’re the only thing keeping me here. But I am suffering. I think I always will. Nights like this I just want to let go. The pain is unbearable. I can’t say it any other way but that. I hurt. I’ve always hurt. I’m tired of hurting. 

Life is ugly and people are cruel, it’s really that simple. 

Everyday I get out of bed and go to work. I fucking try so hard to participate in society but I feel like it’s pointless. 

For most of life, the dream of finding someone to love who understood and accepted my pain was keeping me alive. I found him and we spent two magical years together but it turns out he didn’t love me. And my deeper fear came true: that the person I loved most in this world would disappear. He left me and found someone else. I can’t get over the betrayal. 

Thoughts of suicide have been constant. I can’t even get help because I’m uninsured. And I’ve spent years navigating this broken mental health system. Pills don’t work, therapy has failed me, honestly taking mushrooms was what saved my life. It helped me see things from a different perspective. I think they wore off, because I’m starting to feel trapped in the old thought patterns again. Oh, it doesn’t help that my ex was a fucking therapist. Him and all his co-workers were some of the coldest, most selfish people I’ve met. 

I have completely lost faith in humanity. If it weren’t for my mom and little brother whom I adore, I would have jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge like I almost did back in July. 

I wish I could express myself more eloquently but I’m tired. Of everything. 

If I have to die, then maybe that’s how I choose to live. 

I don’t believe that god would punish me more by sending me to hell. I’m already in it. 

I don’t really care what happens to me, because I know deep down that anything is better than this. ",depression
48347,"I can see it all perfectly in my head, even if I don't have the guts to go through with itI take a warm shower, and linger there, feeling the hot water cascade over me, almost burning me. I’m crying and smiling under the water. Relief begins in my stomach and spreads to my fingertips. When I get dressed, I put on my favourite shirt. I blow-dry and curl my hair. I put on makeup, and the girl in the mirror is beautiful in her calm.

I do the dishes and clean the kitchen so my sister comes home to a tidy house. I make my bed, and, as an afterthought, make hers too. I pick up my cat, press my face into his soft fur, stroke his ears as he purrs and looks at me with his luminous green eyes. I wonder if he’ll understand. Do cats have any concept of such things? I ask him, but he just keeps looking at me with those big eyes, purring and reticent as always.

I take a taxi to the forest about five kilometres from my house. It’s full of alien trees, tall pines that were never supposed to grow here. They stand silent sentinel, an army of watchers, and as I pass between them, I feel safe in their ranks. The air is all moss-green and cold, and my breath mists in tiny clouds from my lips. Dead leaves whisper under my boots as I hike deeper into the forest, brushing dew-drops from bushes as I pass.

This is a popular trail, but this time of day, it’s deserted. I’ve heard horror stories of girls dragged into the undergrowth, raped and beaten and left for dead. Bizarrely, I am afraid, and hope to reach my destination safely.

And where is my destination? I’m not sure yet, but I think I’ll know it when I see it. I push onwards, leaving the trail, venturing further into the embrace of the trees. I want to go where nobody else has gone. I don’t want anyone to find me, not for a while.

Watery sunlight filters through the treetops far above me, and my footsteps are muffled by a sweet-smelling carpet of fallen needles. Birdsong echoes from branch to branch, and a squirrel darts across my path, bright eyes and bushy tail flashing in a stray dapple of sun. I’m smiling, and all at once, I feel complete. I feel part of this forest, breathing with it, smelling its wet-leaf smells and hearing its quiet business stirring in my own head. I’ve reached my spot, I think. This is it.

From my bag, I take the sturdy hemp rope, and loop it over a high branch. I pull out the folding stool and set it up beneath the branch, and climb up on to it. I am afraid, but the fear feels far away, distant to the calm that has come over me.
In my pocket is my ID, a little bit of money left over from the cab fare, and a handwritten note. I spent a long time writing it, because it would be the last thing left of me, and I wanted it to be perfect. I don’t want to cause anyone any more pain than necessary.

Smiling, I take one last deep breath of the damp forest air, tasting pine needles and trapping some birdsong in my lungs. Then I exhale, releasing the birdsong, and kick the stool from under my feet.

I hope it isn’t a child who finds me. I hope my eyes are closed, so whoever does find me doesn’t have to look into them. I hope my note is enough. I hope my parents’ hearts don’t break, and I hope my sister can still go on her long-awaited holiday to Prague with her boyfriend, and I hope her boyfriend forgives me for dying on his birthday. I hope my one true love, so far away and so broken and hopeless, never hears of my death. I would spare him that. I don’t want him thinking it’s his fault. I hope the world is a little kinder; I hope that, somehow, my death, my sacrifice, will appease some karmic god, and that my last selfish act will have some sort of selfless ripple in the universe. It’s a vain hope, but I suppose I can afford it to myself; one last delusion. If a dying girl can’t kid herself that her death means something, then who can?

I hope they can forgive me for leaving them behind. I love you all.

Edit: I'm not encouraging suicide. I don't think I'll even be able to kill myself, and I definitely don't want anyone else to harm themselves in any way. What I've written here is a fantasy, and it's romanticised. I'd like to think death would be as calm and peaceful as I've described it, but I really can't say if it will be. It was pretty cathartic to write it out, though, and I wanted to share it. I don't mean to hurt anyone or encourage anyone to hurt themselves, so please don't take it that way.",depression

156963,"i want to die right now more than i have at any other time in my life.i really fucking needed something to go right right now. i graduated college last june with an actuarial degree, and i've been struggling to find a job in my chosen field. i spent september, october, and november doing a series of interviews for an ideal job that i thought i would get for sure, and i found out last week that i didn't get it.

in the meantime i've been working retail. not because i need the money, but because it looks good on a resume to be working. i fucking hate this job. i'm a stockperson. i carry heavy shit and run up and down stairs all day. it makes my body feel so shitty that i can't sleep.

despite all that, i was actually pretty happy this past week. all because a girl i had been seeing back in august randomly showed back up in my life. she was the first and only person i ever kissed. i like her a lot. she ghosted on me before we had any kind of formal relationship. it fucking sucked and i thought about her every day since.

a week ago, she showed up to a weekly comedy show that i do. she knew i'd be there, so i figured she wanted to see me. i texted her the day after, and we wound up getting coffee that sunday. it went really well. it felt like she was remembering what made her like me in the first place, and she texted me a lot afterwards.

we went to an open mic together last night, and that went really well too. i had a good comedy set. she gave an amazing musical performance. i invited her over afterwards, and she said she couldn't had work the next morning, but that she would be at my show tonight.

she came, i had a great show, we talked afterward. once again, asked if she wanted to hang out afterward. she hesitated for a few minutes. i pretended to pay attention to some other conversation while she thought about it. then she said no.

so she definitely does not like me in the way i like her anymore. and that's the story of my fucking life. and that fucking sucks. today i cared about so many things. i wanted to see my friends. i wanted to write new jokes. i wanted to write for a website my friend is launching. i wanted to listen to an album that my favorite rap group is releasing tomorrow. i wanted to watch neo yokio on netflix. i wanted to listen and laugh at comedy podcasts.

So last night was the first night in a while where I thought I had enough energy to do it. Never been this real before but I felt my brain was numb, no tears, no anxiety, just focus and hopelessness. Not hopelessness of self esteem but hopelessness of being hopeful. I was thinking to go to the exact spot where I dreamed of it happening and sticking to the decision the moment I walked out my front door. Never wanted to leave a note but I’m gonna start here and see where I get. I don’t want to call this seasonal depression or captive depression or any nonsensical depression that proves useless and curable. I wanna call this restless hopelessness. Nothings left for me to be sad about because my feelings go numb and I literally feel the bliss go through my body when I’m still and imaging my nothingness. I don’t know where my mind goes. It drifts. I don’t wanna make a sappy note. If we’re sticking to the facts and being logical, as non sensical and ironic that sounds coming from a depressed kid. Don’t be sad if I leave. Be angry. Drive to find a real cure. patience is not a cure when it comes to being happy. Patience and support are like a Dopamine drip to a kidney failure patient. Striving to get the transplant but surviving off of medication until they’re skin turns yellow. Family Love only ever drove me to resenting why I am so emotionally ugly and why I treat everyone great so I can mask the fact that I am really just another spec of star dust in a universe that doesn’t care if I’m ash. I want you to listen while I make this note. I want you to understand what it really feels like even though your brain and body hopefully never will. I want you to listen when I tell you that working through it and pushing harder than ever isn’t working for me. I need a reason of emotion. I have a great life but for what? I can strive but I can’t reach. I can try but I’ll never see what it really feels like to be normal again. I can name every reason as to why I am wrong but don’t convince me I’m wrong, convince my brain, my subconscious . Convince me that sadness of my own is less than sadness of others but take care of my own while I mourn the sadness of others. I don’t want to share this. My mind is clearing up. It always try’s its best in the moment to carve a path to a clear view but one of these days the storms going to be to thick and I won’t feel drowsy. And on that day I hope to whatever the hell is pushing me, to just have a little mercy. I love you guys, I love you.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see.

Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls.

I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them.

I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police.

Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge.

My own diagnosis:
I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents.
I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. 
Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team.

The help im looking for:
I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from... Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things.

Thanks for reading and any support given.
Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

Like I think so much about suicide and wanting to fuck up my entire body with drugs and shit n yet here I am eating. Eating food better spend on someone actually deserving, someone who appreciates it more than me. I hate breathing, eating, drinking, I hate being alive. I’m guilty of saying Ima kill myself to people who I just wanted attention from. I didn’t get it and I feel fucking terrible. Now no one hits me up, I talk to no one and I feel isolated and alone. I actually wish death on me everyday but I don’t tell anyone. Why would I tell other people how I feel if I don’t have the actual guts to pull it off? Why tell a lie?!?! Why the fuck would I involve more people to care about me if I really were to kill myself? I hate this all and I wanna be done. I don’t wanna feel, see, hear, breathe, or even give someone the chance to know me cuz at the end of the day, my sadness brings others down too.

229722,"I don't want to be brave.Yesterday my psychiatry professor stood on the podium and said in the most sympathetic voice ""I think people struggling with mental illness are incredibly brave"".

Now I know it sounds like a completely innocus statement. But I'm sick of hearing it. It's all bullshit. These people don't actually understand the experience of living through it/ with it. They feel so satisfied with themseves after saying these empty words, so smug that they understand mental illness and those living with it. Just admit it: you are too normal to understand.

There are no positives of mental illness. If I could choose being normal over ""brave"", I would do so in a heartbeat. Being ""brave"" all day exhausts me. I'm at war with my own self in my head all day. There is no glory in this battle. Don't romanticize my struggle.

You can't make a mentallly ill person feel better by telling them they are brave. I don't want to be brave, I want to leave.",depression

Nor will it because I don't have money for medicine, therapy, or hospitalization. I've got a method that should be pretty foolproof as well. Now it's only a matter of time.

342745,"So I recently became Vegan... I hate it. Dear Reddit,

Recently, ~~I~~

~~my parents~~

My mom basically became a vegan. God damn its already happening. For reasons I cannot mentally disclose, she just started watching crack heads explain health benefits of crack. Now, I don’t have a problem really with vegans. You do your lifestyle and I'll do mine. I can't love what you love and you don’t love what I love. Just do you, but don’t do it around me. Ok yada yada. I don’t like eating what vegans eat. I think eating chlorophyll for the last week is driving me crazy. Like bitch I'm not a tree.

Anyway I’m 16, so I can't leave out on my own yet. So, I plan on killing my mom and eating her flesh. I am writing this so when you see me on Twisted Minds, First 48, and Fox News so you can have some back story. Now I’m not sure the method killing I’ll use but there is a 90% chance we were home alone I just chopped her. Now wait, she made you eat broccoli and u want to eat her flesh, isn't that a bit far? Now let me ask you this? Imagine eating actually food for like the first 16 years of your life and then you have to eat the bush summoned from the deepest part of the amazon rain forest where the plants themselves do not even use the same air as animals. You wouldn’t be the happiest person would you. “I get that but, your killing ur mom over kidney beans...”. Actually, I think I got the irrational thinking from her. Picture this, you came from the store, 200 dollars' worth of groceries. 5 mins later you recommended a video by the cringiest youtuber for the FIRST time then you fucking yeet everything that was within 6 feet of anything that ever fucking blinked in the fucking trash can. My dad is simp. He is/was a pescatarian, and he fucking assisted her in her fucking madness. He only ate fish, now he is eating fucking leaves. If that’s not a simp I don’t know what is. This type of shit happens to a kid named toby who lives in Wisconsin.

It's partly my fault though. She started cooking some vegan food and she was like the best cook apart from me, but I don’t like to make a whole meal, excuse me, an entre for like entire the village of people who occupy my house. She was like here is tofu. I should have picked that shit up right there. Name two people you know who eats fucking tofu. She was like how does it taste. It's my mom, I love, used to love my mom. It doesn’t have a fucking flavor. I forgot I fucking ate it. To this day I’m waiting for the fucking chlorophyll to interact with my taste buds. That was the hardest I have ever lied my life. 

Morale of the story, if you like something, that doesn’t mean you have to force it on people who you know without consent. That’s taste rape. Just wait, you could have waited like 2 years, patience is key. I’ll remember that when I’m in the mental institute for the next 64 years.

At least they’ll have a variety of foods.

On a side note: How the to cook human flesh, like do I just season it or like, you know never mind I’ll just find out,

Tl;dr My parents have spasmodically quit regular food and went for an extreme vegan diet, which I am  heavily opposed to, but they say ""I learn to like it"" so I plan on doing a Jeffery Dahmer.",non-depression

I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but I still do. I know it's not healthy. I know it just makes my self esteem plummet. Though I am a rather homely girl. Maybe I deserve to feel like shit.

It's so petty. I don't think I should be here right now. Being in an eternal state of nothing sounds incredibly tempting.

7074,"I am so evil and worthlessFuck throwaway accounts, this is the real me.

Despite being raised in a comfortable environment with nary a want in sight I find myself far beyond the edge. I've lived with an aching sense of emptiness and lack of emotion for over 15 years now, despite only being 22 as of this April. I hate myself for even beginning to feel like this for what I have and for the fact that there are so many people in this world who are far worse off than I am.

My mother is sympathetic and tries to help and all I do is shun her away with what little bit of emotion I have left, anger. I have been through many sessions of therapy and many antidepressants and yet I feel I have no place in this world. The only thing that is keeping me alive is the debt I yet owe to my parents from my college loans, which are still piling up as I somehow trudge forward. Despite being on my way to becoming a pharmacist, I have no hope for the future and would rather just end it all here.

I have been close to suicide before but at this moment I have a knife in front of me. I feel like ending it all at this moment despite my debts. Despite the horror I know I would inflict on my family, everything just feels right. I am such a worthless creature that I can't even take into consideration how others would feel.

I can't feel love.

I can't feel anything.

-The second part is the will to stop. If you don’t have that, you won’t stop.

i worry though. i haven’t been able to do much as of late. i am scared that i will be too depressed to have a good time with him on his special day, and that that’s impression that i will be leaving him with. not as a brother who loves him and wants to be happy and spend time with him. but as an asshole, who can’t drag his depressed junkie ass off his floor for a few hours to celebrate his little brother’s birthday, and then kills himself because boohoo. 

there’s been a lot of deaths in the family this last month or two and we have someone else very close who is on their way out, and i’d hate to add to it. but i am, and have been for years, nothing more than a ticking time bomb.

139110,"I am close to the edge, but want to be pulled back...Please listen to my story, and offer advice... I am so alone. I don't really want to burden anyone else, but, well, I feel like Im sliding toward my grave and my fingernails are the only thing stopping me from falling in, and I need help. 

5 years ago my father passed away, and my life just started tumbling out of control. My Dad, despite his faults, was someone who loved me so very deeply, and I miss him so much. So, in deep depression I tried to take action to make it better, quitting my job and using my inheritance to go to mental health ""spa"" to try to get my mind together. Using a combination of exercise, diet and therapists I felt better than I had in years, and while there I met this beautiful, awesome girl and fell in love… I then decided to move to New England, and we had so much fun together.

Unfortunately, since then, the relationship crumbled late last year, I havent found a job, I lost 2 close friends (1 to a heart attack, 1 who killed herself after I turned her down for a date), my car was repossessed and all of this was because I found myself in a crushing depression. I went home to my Moms house for a week, and she saw how depressed I was, and sent me to her therapist.

I came back to NE, and saw a therapist weekly, and starting about 2 months ago slowly started to climb out of depression, and from the looks of it my finally started getting better.  I had a great job interview, and believe I will get the job next week.

But, then things crashed.  I havent had any money for a few months, and I am now being kicked out of my apartment, I have no place to go, and since I am so close to being health and having a job, I called my Mom for emergency help, needing to only last one more month, and she not only said no, she told me not to contact her.

So, I am now only totally broke, have no idea where I am going to go Sunday, I have been vomiting from stress, unable to sleep, can barely eat, and the only thing that pops up in my mind is suicide. Bad things just keep happening, and depression is ruining my life. Just when I think Im escaping it, something smacks me down… and I am so very tired.

I don't want this to be the rest of my life. I don't want to homeless. I am so ashamed.

My friends have distanced themselves, My sister calls me immature and tells me I need to grow up, my Mom wont talk to me, my brother has his own load to carry, and my therapist doesn't see past the surface.  Reddit, I cry all the time. I look at the tool I want to use to kill myself, and know that it would only be uncomfortable for like a minute, and then nothing would hurt ever again. I know suicide would hurt everyone around me, but how long can I last feeling like this.. Im just so tired.

I even went into a church today ,and begged God for help. Nobody answered so far.

I just want to crawl into a pile of love and heal for a month, I need love.. Im so alone,  but there isn't anyone out there who is loving me.. whats wrong with me? 

Im sorry for rambling, I just.. I don't know what to do anymore, and don't want to burden anymore people with my sadness, or my life. I just seem to let people down all the time.

319080,"How do I not get so stressed out I that I want to dieI feel like everything is too much. I'm so frustrated all I want to do is cry all the time. I can't find a summer job and don't know what I'm going to do I just want to cry. I'm sick of people trying to form relationships and get close to me bc I'm just going to fuck them up. (I have this one guy that I really really like but I'm not ready to have a relationship and I'm really going to ruin his life bc I get upset and angry all the time and can't get any help)

My first relationship ended about 7 months ago (it went on for 2 years) and was with an abusive asshole who had suicidal issues and was ""over"" them and when we met (I was 16) and at the worst part of my personal struggle (but I got over it thankfully all thanks to myself so I'm happy about that) but then he got worse and blamed me for it and said all these rude things to me and yelled at me when I would come home from college (he was older and dropped out bc he's a scumbag that can't do anything) and would just use me for sex and rape me and yell at me and essentially tell me that my vagina was disgusting. Like okay. It doesn't help that my family brings him up all the time like I don't need a fucking reminder AND my mom fucking DEFENDS him (like when I say he's the scum of the earth and she just goes on about how he's had a hard life like oh I'm sorry, does that give him an excuse to be rude to me?) even AFTER I tried to talk to her about what he said to me so that's a lost cause (I never even bothered to mention that he would force me to have sex with him and he wouldn't use a condom and I was always worried I was pregnant but I never brought that up to her bc why bother?). Because of that what little I ever cared about her that was left is gone.

My mother is a moron and smokes with severe asthma and is in the hospital all the time. So I can't ask for help bc she's always the center of attention and we probably don't have any money after what she's pulled. It doesn't help that she fucked up our relationship years ago and I have to pretend like I even care about her. I would rather move out and never speak to my family again but I can't, because money is stupid. (I don't need to talk about my mom I'm over it I just don't want to turn into a nasty bitch like her)

Finances are one thing that really stress me out and it doesn't help that I was already worried before my mother had to go to the hospital this weekend. I don't have time for this. I'm just done. I want to move out and leave bc I'm so much happier at college when I never have to see her (or my sister she can be very rude) but I really love my dad and I was only going to stay at home for him and my dog, but my baby died about 2 months ago and I don't have a reason to anymore. I'm so beyond frustrated and I just want to stop ceyinfn and stop hurting people and get help but I can't bc my mother is the center of attention and I don't want my extended family to think I'm a looney bc I need help. I just want to die in so done and it's been a while since the last time I felt really bad (about 2 years ago when I was 17, I'm 19 now) but I'm just so frustrated and I just want to leave. 

Im sorry for the rant I'm just really frustrated and if you even got through that or if it even made any sense thank you so much :)

Random: just more about the guy I like bc he really is a sweetheart and is so nice but I don't want to break him he's so sweet and so nice and I can tell he cares about me and he never takes advantage of me or anything and is always support but part of me wants him to just leave bc I'm tired of people seeing how vulnerable I can be when I get upset like this and a tiny part of me is still worried he might try to hurt me, but I don't worry about that much anymore I'm just worried I'm going to break him and make him suicidal again ",depression

I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like I will grow up to be a useless shit, at school I'm a failure. I keep trying as hard as I can but, I just can't pass. Every time I find a way I can possibly go by it fails me, I feel as if every day I'm dragged down more and more theres no way I can catch up. I'm actually among one of the last 100 people that are doing poorly in school. I feel stupid and useless, I'm a complete failure to my family. I don't know why I'm still alive if all I have waiting for me is failure and a shit life. Every time someone asks me how school is going I just any help but feel like crap because the truth is that I'm failing 5 classes out of 7. It's not just my problems with education, my social life is practically nonexistent. I don't have much friends or anything and I doubt any of them give a fuck about me. According to most to my sister (and other people in my family that are my age) it would be better if we weren't seen together because I'm an embarrassment. I know I'm not good looking and I'm freaking fat (20 pounds overweight) so I guess I know why people don't want me around. I feel like I drag people down with me and people see me as a piece of shit on society. I haven't felt happy in a long time, I guess I've felt happy moments but never truly happy. Compared to everyone else I'm nothing I'm just a loser seeking attention. I feel like an attention whore because theres so many people with problems and I'm here asking for sympathy. At home i'll never make my parents proud, I'll always be an embarrassment to my sister and a burden to everyone else. Nobody cares, everyone says its just because I want attention and I want sympathy because I'm pathetic. All I've ever wanted was someone to actually care about me, or not think I'm a piece of shit. I wish I did good in school, but it won't happen. Why do I keep going? 
I feel like a stupid dramatic little girl, because maybe its just a faze, I'm a 16 year old girl and maybe it will pass.
I think if I died, no one would care, there would just be less shit in society.
In the end I serve no purpose to the social organism of humanity and nobody could give a shit about me.

Height doesn't fucking matter. To most of the girls. 5'9 or 6'0 is NOT the bare minimum required. Sure, some women prefer men like that, but that's their own preferences. And they don't represent every women on the planet. Memes and all shaming these women just adds to the insecurity of shorter men and does no good. ( Ngl, some are hella funny)

Now, this is not coming from a 15yr old girl. I'm a 5'3 guy.  And I have literally turned down a girl who grew a crush on me when I was there for her during a mentally tough time. I don't wanna go into that but I just said that to show all of you shorter insecure fellas out there that you just gotta be nice.

My life was great and I was so happy. My online business was going great bringing in money while I was in class. Now it's doing like absolute shit and my competitor is beating me pretty badly.

Me and my ex were absolutely in love with each other. I had been with her for a year and I was positive this was the girl I would spend the rest of my life with. She broke up with me because she saw I was becoming a bum among other things that I could have done better. Basically I would still have her right now if I wasn't such a fuckup. I keep trying to tell myself that it was a ""learning experience"" and that the next one will be better.

My situation isn't getting any better. I still feel like shit every single day and I don't know how much longer I can take it. Add to this that a few of my friends have broken up with their girlfriends but they are back together. It just makes me wonder why that can't happen to me as well.

My life is just full of regret and I don't see any way out of it without putting in a bunch of effort. And even then it's not a sure thing. I don't want to have put in all this effort only to fail and be back where I am now.

I texted my ex a month after she broke up with me and she wanted nothing to do with me. All of her friends think I'm a monster and her parents hate me. I have been going over the idea of showing up to her house with roses. If it goes bad I am going to go downtown, go up to the roof of my old apartment building and jump. It's not the ideal way to die. I'd much rather go instantly but I have no access to guns or anything. I figure if I don't change my mind on my drive there I won't change my mind on the way down. The other option is the exit bag but that can apparently make you severely brain damaged if you don't do it properly or if somebody finds you before you die. So I've been thinking about sticking to a more sure way.

At this point the only things standing in the way are the fear of jumping and how my parents will feel. They'll feel like they could have done something, or that they're failures as parents. No matter what I write in my note I know the pain from me dying will stay with them forever.

87850,"‘Nostalgia’ - please read That feeling. The one when something sparks a thought. A rememberance of a past memory. Maybe in your childhood. Maybe feelings of pure bliss. Running through fields of grass. The feeling of summer. The heat from the sun in your skin. The smells. The pleasant sensory overload. You feel that feeling. Warm and fuzzy. Like your vibrating. Memories of pure happiness. And then you zoom out. Back to your life now. You become sad. Life was so much better back then. You miss it. You miss everything. Everything was so simple. And good. You were much happier. You want to live in that time forever and ever. But time flies. And 50 years from now you’ll have this same occurrence. Thinking about these times. How they were so much better. Filled with joy. Maybe friends. Family. And now your all old. Parents are gone. Life is boring. It’s grey. You don’t do much. All you’re left with is memories. You wonder where the time has gone. Did it really fly by that quick. It couldn’t have. I can’t be think old already. I’m almost at my end. I had a lot more stuff I wanted to do. I never did this or that. Man I miss those times. Those memories. I wish I spent every living second to the fullest that I could. I shouldn’t of cared about money. Or school. Because none of that matters now. On my death bed. All I’m left with are memories. Positive and negative. I wish I lived more. Traveled the world on foot. Met thousands of people. Had so many amazing friends. Amazing experiences. Fell in love over and over again. I wish I lived. It’s best to live your life. Break your addictions. Get rid of your phone. Save up. Downgrade to a flip phone. Switch your SIM cards. Find a cool group fo friends. Get closer. Encourage them to do the same. And keep going. Keep living. Have fun. Be alive. Be real. Be in the moment. Because one day that’s all you’ll have. Memories of what you did now. Did you really think you’ll be satisfied with laying in your bed all day on your phone. Do you really think you wouldn’t want to just go back and knock some sense into your younger self. Live life. Remember when you were young and wanted to grow up so bad because of all the freedom it would give you. Everyone told you no. Slow down. You want to cherish these times. You didn’t believe them. You had no perspective. You grew up anyways. And now. Now you realize they were right. Those were the best times. I’m grown up now. I wish I lived more during them. I wish I lived in the moment. Embraced being a child. Well that’s how it is now. Your current reality and everything you’re doing at this exact moment is playing like a movie in your future selfs mind. What do you think they would say about what you’re doing right now? Please. Live your life. Throw away your phone. Band up with some friends and LIVE. Truly live. Because life is short. Very short. And once you’re on your deathbed. The truly most valuable things in the world will be your positive memories and experiences. So make the old you happy. Make them feel okay with their life. Make them feel consent. Like they truly lived. And didn’t waste it. And weren’t just wishing for more time. Shift your perspective for a moment. Ask yourself.

221051,"People have abused, neglected, suppressed my potential to such a degree that in the future i'd probably consider murdering a person.Emotional abuse of a child is commonly defined as a pattern of behavior by parents or caregivers that can seriously interfere with a child’s cognitive, emotional, psychological or social development.

Stimulation of children in early development stages forms their character for the future. With weak mental stimulation, there is poor mental development in children, resulting in problems like poor school learning, lower intellectual ability, unstable emotional reactions and many more. Additionally, intellectual development is affected by the traits exhibited by the parents.

Talking to children provides one of the most effective forms of stimulus for child mental development. Research has shown when parents interact with the child a great deal; there is better cognitive, social and emotional development in children, leading to better skills at mathematics, enhanced reasoning and self-expression.

I feel like mental and emotional under-stimulation combined with abuse have severely damaged my cognition and sense of well being. Memories of being neglected, taunted, and abused other the years has driven me to insanity. A couple years ago while i was working i became increasingly unhappy and began to develop chronic sleep deprivation while I was working and a had a complete psychotic breakdown, almost schizophrenic like episode and nobody was there to help me. My coworkers took advantage of the situation and only helped to make my breakdown of reality more robust and extended. After the breakdown happened and i returned to reality and coworkers only ramped up the abuse and neglected, no compassion, not even an acknowledgement, nobody even talked to me about what happened to this day. I had a complete psychotic breakdown and not my friends, parents, or coworkers even acknowledged or talked to me about what happened. Completely neglected. 

I've been neglected and abused my entire life. If i mentioned a problem i was having while growing up, i was ignored. Nobody in my family was ever positive to me, i was never given any positive emotional stimulation. I felt like my parents ignored my state of well being my entire childhood and teenage years.

They are the world’s worst animal and they are bad at every. To start instead of evolving to eat normal fucking food they evolved to eat a plant that is poisonous to most animals that has almost no nutritional value. They get so little energy from this plant that they have to sleep 20+ hours a day and when they are away they have to constantly eat or they will die. They also only reproduce through rapeing each other. Also when they are baby’s they drink their mother’s milk which has a decent amount of nutrients. But then they have to stop so they go to eat a poisonous plant. So they eat there parents shit to get used to the toxin(for you nerds I know that it’s not technically their shit but it’s basically the same thing). Also they have not evolved to do what almost all other land animals have learned to do which is drink water. They only learned how because fire fighters gave them water to drink during the wild fires. They also have spinal fluid in their skulls so when they fall out of trees because they forget to hold on. Also they have very small and very smooth brains. They also sometimes die because they forget to hold on to trees.

Both two psychologists I have seen and my boyfriend think that my life isn’t bad at all, and I have no reason to be depressed. Despite that I told them about my suicidal intentions, one of my psychologist asked me if I “just want to live my life to the fullest” because she didn’t think I have serious problems. The other psychologist said that he thought I had been functioning well. I have to mention that both of the two psychologist I have seen are reliable and experienced. They have been working in the clinic in my college for years. So their words should have some truth within. However I have no idea why I’m feeling so bad from time to time.


My boyfriend, being more blunt than the psychologists, said he thought I was spoiled. In the end I don’t trust anyone and I have to deal with the whole thing by myself. I can’t talk to my parents either. They have put a lot of expectation on me, spending a lot of money on my education and I cannot let them down. Maybe my issue is not the typical depression which is much more acute and persistent. I have been feeling bad about myself and my life since 13 years old until now (21 years old), and yet nobody knows I’m depressed unless I tell them.

She didn’t bother to try to comfort me throughout our discussion (if you can even call it that) which, again, I wasn’t expecting much but I didn’t think it was going to be this bad. So while I sound a mess telling her how things have been rough for a long time, she basically says to get to the point because she has a meeting once third period ends (she said that she had a meeting shortly and if I would like help I should tell her what exactly is bothering me. She said it in a very aggressive and indignant tone). Shocked by this, I struggle to find my words and don’t know how to say “I want to kill myself” so I’m mumbling an stuttering because of how uncomfortable and unwelcomed I feel. She then proceeds to cut me off and tells me that she understands. She understands that I’m going through a rough time and that life has its ups and downs after all. But if I can’t tell her exactly what’s wrong then she can’t help me and goes on to make this bullshit ass analogy about this being like a patient not telling the doctor the symptoms for the doctor to determine what’s wrong. I try to and she then proceeds to say that everyone goes through difficulties and that It’s normal, but we can’t allow ourselves to fall apart because one bad thing happened. If that was the case “everyone would be like” me, incoherent with their words and unable to make progress with a situation. She tells me that she can recommend a support group, a few school clubs targeted to raise social awareness (which WTF does that even mean), and provide me with the contact information of local psychiatrists, but if I can’t thoroughly explain what’s wrong then maybe I should compose myself and thoughts and (quote, I don’t think I’ll ever forget this) “deal with it. It’ll be tough but everyone goes through hard times and not everyone falls apart because of it. This is proof that you can work past this.” 

At this point I’m so fucking pissed and honestly on the verge of tears so I just walk out and apologize for wasting her time. She doesn’t call after me or even tries to get me to go back to her office.

My one attempt at wanting to fix my suicidal thoughts blows up in my face and results in me wanting to die even more. Honestly, fuck that bitch. When I kill myself in April I’m going to write a lengthy suicide note in which I’ll make sure to mention her and that situation. Hopefully when I die she’s the first one to know.this just further validated my belief that people don’t give a shit and I can’t believe I was stupid enough to change this thought

TL;DR: Went to school counselor and she was annoyed and bitchy throughout our whole meeting. Basically told me to deal with it like everyone else and didn’t even try to go after me when I walked out of her office",depression

Here are the tips which helped me during high school and they are still useful in college for me at least.

1) The secret to look cool in front of everyone is giving respect. The bad boy theme is sooo 90s.

2) All the boys and girls who think you are not good looking or pretty, it is just in your head. You look fucking amazing. Just groom yourselves properly and see the magic yourself. You will be oozing out confidence like never before.

2.1) Don't fell bad if you don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend, you will eventually get one. These things shouldn't be rushed. If you are making relationships just for the sake of having one, there is a huge chance that you won't be happy in the long run and might miss the chance to meet someone who is actually perfect for you. So just relax...and enjoy your single life also.

3) Give respect to teachers who are nice to you and don't be a jerk to them, they also feel bad and have mental breakdown. For the bad teachers....show them hell.

4) Never compare your wealth with other kids, it's not cool.

5) Don't worry about your studies and do what you like the most. That doesn't mean to completely neglect your studies, try as hard as you can and if it still doesn't work then don't stress yourself too much. Just have faith in yourself and you will definitely succeed.

77888,"What would happen if, while in therapy, I express suicidal ideation AND reveal that I have access to a firearm at home? Could I be committed?This doesn't exactly feel like the correct subreddit for this but I figured some people here would have first hand experience. I live in California. 

I've been in therapy with a LCSW for a short period of time now. My suicidal ideation is sometimes discussed but I have not been open about the fact that I do have access to a gun in my home (it belongs to a family member and is unsecured thus accessible to me). This is really eating at me because suicidal ideation is something that I have struggled with over many months, even years now but with more regularity and intensity in the past half year. I know that I need help managing it. In my ideation, the gun is my method of suicide; however, I don't exactly feel suicidal currently...? In fact, I have never tried to harm myself before nor am I actively planning an attempt. But I frequently desire death, feel extremely depressed, and fantasize about killing myself. I also often fear that I could and would/will kill myself.

I don't know what to do. I really want to be open about the gun and my troubling thoughts but I live with my family and am TERRIFIED of them finding out about my mental health issues and suicidal ideation. I recently came across a news article about a California man's guns being confiscated because his wife was voluntarily committed for mental illness (this occurred in 2013 though). I guess my fear is that I'll be committed too or that law enforcement will attempt to confiscate my family member's gun. In either scenario, my family would undoubtedly learn of the situation and I just so desperately want to avoid that.

Do you have a similar experience? Do you know what the protocol is if a patient reveals a plan and means (being a firearm), but not necessarily active or immediate intent? What is the likelihood that law enforcement would attempt to confiscate the firearm?

I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the girls on this subreddit. The accusations regarding my so called ""behavior"" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accuser/s (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: 🤔

1.) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.

2.) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this group were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Every head of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it to you but we really do exist.

3.) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people.

4.) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a ""threat"". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here awaiting an apology.

5.) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this post, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called ""opinion"" no matter how misguided it may be. As you can tell my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the sub.",non-depression

313777,"The need for a ropeI feel like I have a physical need to commit suicide. I constantly imagine how good it would feel to wrap a rope around my neck and just end it all. I've had this feeling for a few years now, but it's gotten a lot worse during this year because the world seems to be on a downhill and everything moving into sickening direction. I daydream everyday about how I'd just put a rope to the ceiling and get a stool and just choke to death.

I'm 25-years old and I feel like I've failed in my life miserably. I'm not productive, to be fair, I haven't done anything productive ever. I've always taken the easiest route and it's no surprise that I'm unemployed and have no education and no plans for the future. I hustle things here and there, leech of my friends and siblings and collect welfare to get by. I'm from a welfare state and it's a very shameful thing to be at the bottom of a society when you're living in a welfare state. My whole family is at the bottom of the society and it's always been like this. But, I have had every possibility available for me, but still I haven't done anything with my life. I cannot use my poor upbringing and the neighborhood I came from as an excuse because the education, healthcare and etcetera are free here. I'm a failure, that's the harsh truth and there's no denying that. I've always felt dumb and now I know that to be true. I used to have optimism but it's all gone now after watching these years just pass by and nothing changing. I've tried but never enough, I'm not capable enough to try enough to succeed over the ones who are naturally more talented and capable than me and have had a head start in life. 

It seems like my future is written. It's either that I continue doing nothing and just use all sorts of escapism to make my life tolerable or get a low paying job which I will hate and do it for the rest of my life and live somewhat respectable life. That low paying job is behind of a lot of work for me because the employment in my country is so fucked that nobody will hire anyone who's my age and has no work experience so that option feels like too much effort for the reward. I had such big expectations when I was a little younger but the reality slapped me hard to the face and I've only realized that I'm average at best and probably below average most of the time and there's no way I can ever do anything of significance in this world. I cannot ever make my family or friends really proud which I've always wanted to. I constantly ask myself that what's the point in living if you are of no value to society and to the greater good. Sure, my family and friends may get some joy out of my existence but it doesn't change the fact that I'm an spineless excuse for a human being and that I do nothing productive.

I want a purpose in life and I want to show an example to my younger siblings so that they don't have to end up like I am now or like how most of my family have. But, what kind of purpose can dumb fucker like me have in this world? If I'd work hard, I could come your below average working class citizen, but I know that I'd hate everyday that kind of life. I'd be fine in some professions, but I feel like I'm too retarded or socially handicapped for every profession that I would actually like to do. 

I wanna end this saying that I'm not going to kill myself for now because I know that it would hurt my family and likely my friends as well, I just wanted to write this out. Pardon for my English.",depression

119697,"Tips to pulling an all-nighter I know y’all like staying up all night. It’s fun. You get to play video games and stuff. So from a person who’s had some experience, here’s some advice. 
1. Never look at the time. If you look at the time and you see it’s later than you normally stay up, your body will get pretty tired. 
2. Always have food or drink to give you energy. That’s the nature of food. It gives you energy.  Do NOT drink energy drinks  or caffeine unless it’s the tail-end of your all nighter. They will make you tired after they wear off. I’d recommend things like water or protein shakes to drink instead. 
3. Have something to distract you from your tiredness. You’re gonna be tired, but if you distract yourself, you won’t notice. Watching action movies or playing video games are some things you can do. If you’re studying for a test or doing homework, have music that will keep you awake. 
4. Don’t try too hard. Effort makes you tired. Just chill and act like this is your standard routine.

During quarantine I felt super lonely like probably everybody else and I had this boy that I was talking to almost every day. You know something casual I didn't want anything romantic from it. And we became really close, u know he was my guy best friend. 

In the country where I live quarantine ended around June and we were able to go out and stuff. But I didn't have any friends but him at the time, that I can go out with, he offered me to hang out with his friends but I didn't want because they were really toxic. And after like 1, 2 months he and his other friend started going out with people that I knew(now keep in mind that im very introverted and can't connect to people that much). So in the end of summer I started hanging out with them. His friends were very nice. We had a great time, we became close. And most importantly I was feeling good around them. 

And then little by little he started acting really bad. I mean he is rude disrespectful of the things that I have done for him. He doesn't  ask me to hangout anymore. He lies when I ask him will u go out today. He changed. And I don't know why. When I go out whit him and now I can say our friends(because I became close with them too)I feel unwanted. And also I forgot that when he is not in town or is busy they always call me to hangout. I think its really him that has something against me. 

I don't know I feel lost, I cry myself to sleep almost every night. Which seems a little dramatic. I know if someone is acting like this u better leave them but if I stop being friends whit him I loose everybody else.

I've had a pretty mediocre adult life, I spent my childhood skipping grades and graduating early and always being told I was going to do something special with my intelligence and my life. When I got to college I didn't know what to do and I ended up dropping out because I couldn't handle the social pressure combined with deciding my life. (afterwards diagnosised and therapy for aspergers, which had been misdiagnosised as OCD, ADHD, and Depression. 

Here I am nearly 30, I work a blue collar shitty job that barely pays the bills. And recently the one aspect of my life I was happy with...turned to shit.

I was friends with this girl, she liked me but I was oblivious too it, until we became roommates. Then we started sleeping together platonically then as lovers. She has kids and for the better part of a year this carried on being lovers, playing house, etc. Then a guy she was interested in but never has time for her, wanted to try and make time. And she dumped me and broke my heart. I've continued on living there...and after that guy broke her heart and she single she doesn't want to be anything more then friends.

I keep trying to tell her...that I can't be just friends. I can't go out to the bar and watch her take someone how, or flirt with other guys. I don't want to be in that situation but if I leave I'll be leaving her financially vulenrable. Ie she can't afford the place without me. So now  I gotta choose between letting down the woman I love down.

And then I've tried moving on somedays are better then others. She doesn't care for me the way I care for her. I'm in love with her, and yet no woman can replace her.

I'm stuck in this stupid loop, I love her, she doesn't love me, I can never replace her. Everytime I go out with another girl, she seems drab and timid in comparison. 

I've gotten low, real low a couple of times and tried to work up the adrenaline to end my pain. Just ended up scarring my arms with hesitation marks.

Through the travel in this physical form, the best time had, was felt while receiving and giving love. It has become the one everlasting obsession to dominate meaning throughout this trial. 

Put simply, thine heart is healed and ready to be open to another yet again. Even still there is a potential love in the make on this day. Alas this is attempt 13billion, my standards are about the clouds. To find an individual that sparks an interest within me is difficult to say plainly. 

Therefore I will travel this current avenue until it's end, which seems close in hand. Except at the end of the day; if I don't find love this time. I am tired of being alone. Tired of getting to know one person after another to have it mean nothing. Tired of getting thine hopes up for nothing. Tired of who I am because clearly I am not liked. Tired of being a nice person to see the assholes of this world succeed.

18916,"Social anxiety is ruining my lifeLife could be great for me. I'm young, I could be everything I want to be. I could have friends. 
But I have social anxiety. Which means every day I wake up and I'm terrified because I'll have to go to school. Which means I will never be able to pursue the career I want because I won't get into university with my grades being pulled down by oral marks and even if I do, how could I ever be a psychologist when I am afraid to talk to people? Which means that I will be stuck in my unhappy relationship forever because he's my only friend and I am absolutely terrified of being alone. 
I just don't want to be like this. Social anxiety isn't just shyness, it's awkwardness, A lot of it. And I hate myself for being this way, so, so much but I can't change. I've been wanting to die for 4 years. I can't face another fucking day at school being the weirdo, I just can't. I'm so done. So fucking done. But I'm too much of a coward to go through with this.

268771,"Gave it the ol' college try; life's not for meI've been trying, I really have. To want things. Stopped thinking negatively, been telling myself everything's fine, it's not that bad. But I'm not bouncing back anymore. Every day I'm closer to doing it; it's chipping away at me.

I don't feel I'm being irrational. I'm not depressed, I just don't want this life. I chose a hard path and now I don't want it anymore. But I chose it, I brought this on myself. So many days stretched out ahead of me, nothing to look forward to. Plenty of shitty memories to look back on. To keep me up at night and punctuate my thoughts throughout the day. Repress them you say? I'm good, but not that good. 

Then there are things I feel I might want, but know will never happen. I try to hold them ahead of me, like a donkey with a carrot, but I'm not even convinced those things would fix it anymore. I've been trying to distract myself, patch the emptiness, but it's not working. In fact, each failed effort is making it worse. Faking it 'til you make it isn't working, it's just making me more fake.

I think about it every day. Multiple times a day, usually. I have a plan, I just question my ability to carry it out, logistically. If I could just press a button and be done, that would be stellar. But I'm a baby who can't stand pain, so that complicates things. 

I don't ""need help"". There isn't another human alive who has the answers. I'm not being irrational. There's no rational reason to live if you don't want to. If you've genuinely tried already. It doesn't mean anything. You can be unhappy, and it can be justified. Doesn't mean you have a mental problem or are depressed. I don't, at least. Down a tonne of 5-HTPs like candy and it does nothing -- looks like my ~brain chemicals ~ are fine

Maybe it's circumstantial. But my circumstances aren't changing any time soon, and I don't think I can push through the next several years when the outcome isn't guaranteed. Even a sure thing wouldn't change my mind anymore, because I don't really want it. I've been trying for years and it's not working, I didn't just decide today. Waiting years is reasonable, no? 

Death comes to everyone; in the grand scheme of things what does shaving off 50yr really change? I understand why people are not suicidal. They know they're going to die eventually but they enjoy the journey. I do not. If that's their reason for living, it's understandable why I don't want to?

4 people will care that I'm gone. And I regret that that's the case, but it's not enough to keep me here anymore. I'm not sitting around waiting for things to get better. But it's been *years*. Surely that's a representative timeframe?

There was no justification for it, just that I was made homeless and since I was with a mental health team, they had a 'duty of care' to put me somewhere. 

My parents fucking despise me and look at me like I'm a disgusting piece of shit. They won't let me in the house, despite the fact I'm in a supported living unit down the road. I don't even have anything I need support with, but I'm just here because they just can't stand me being near them. They told the mental health team I couldn't stay at the house so they put me up in a supported living unit for people with autism/aspergers...which I don't even have.

I don't have the power to change any of this...firstly, I would need money to move, then the emotional resources to cope and some sort of support network but I have nothing. I oscillate between being so confused I can't function, bouts of extreme sadness and INTENSE anger directed both inwards and outwards.

I just feel so awful that when I'm typing these words, I'm struggling to express myself, my brain is just fucking mush. And this anger, it's getting awful. I walk down the street with such hateful thoughts, I feel like strangers are going to attack me or are laughing at me and because of that I'm always ready to defend myself. Honestly...I sometimes feel like I'm going to lash out at someone, I want so badly to just let out all my rage. It's extremely scary...it's such a bloodthirsty, predatory feeling, I am incensed. Otherwise, I'm going to end up killing myself if I keep all of it in.

I have even made plans to end it all. I have made an attempt before, but this time I would chose a more lethal option. I just don't fucking have the energy anymore. This is tortuous. 

Please, can someone offer any advice at least, I can't carry on feeling like this...",depression
295336,"Would committing suicide really be THAT bad for your mom?Everyone always talks about how they are skeptical to end their lives because of how devastated their moms would be. I think about this too. But would it really be that terrible for our moms? I read that the way people think about happiness and sadness is not congruent with the reality of happiness and sadness. People think bad situations will make them really sad, and for a really long time (like deaths of loved ones.) People think happy things will make them happy for a really long time (like marriage, children etc.) But really what happens, is people get a sharp increase in happiness when something good happens, and sadness when something bad, and then their emotional states go back to default relatively quickly after that.

My whole life consists of waking up and barely doing anything- maybe playing my idol games on my phone, watching some YouTube videos that don't interest me because nothing does.

72753,"Feeling hopeless and trapped. Even non-existence would be better.I'm 28, dropped out of school due to being a depressed fuck up, managed to get a job in the field I was studying but lost it due to being a depressed fuck up who couldnt get out of bed to go to work on time because I'm a sperg with no executive function. Got a new job but it's dead end and unfulfilling and I am constantly anxious I will lose it too because between the depression and the spectrum shit I can barely get to work.

Due to being such a fuckup I live at home and my Dad makes my life hell. He has no concept of boundaries and constantly invades my space, takes things I buy away from me because ""you need to pay your bills not buy stupid shit"" when that ""stupid shit"" is the only thing in my life that brings me any joy. He turns off the power to my room if I stay up all night on my fucked sleep schedule because somehow terrorizing me like this will get my life in order. ""It worked when you were in grade school,"" he says to a person pushing 30. He says he's afraid I'll have to end up in a home after he dies but really I'm living it right now. How can I learn to live when he won't let me? I saw my psychiatrist this Thursday and after I regaled her with a tale of how my Dad removed my PS4 which I bought with my own income as a fucking adult and told me I could have it back once I paid off my cc again which I am paying off on my income she asked if I had anyone else, any relatives locally I could live with. But I don't. I don't have anywhere else locally to go, I don't make enough to live by myself and my boyfriend is on the west coast with neither of us having enough money to move in with each other. I'm trying to get better with managing these things but my own brain is trying to sabotage me every step of the way.

My dad fucks with my mom's stuff too BTW, idk how she deals with it. He has zero respect for personal property, his mindset is ""if you just did what you were supposed to I wouldn't have to confiscate things"". He doesn't understand that this is a totally unhelpful way to go about things, his brain can't comprehend it. My dad is a good person but I honestly think he may be where I get the whole spectrum thing from.

Tonight my dad shut the power to my room off again and told me he would be shutting power off every night to get me to bed which only served to enrage me rather than encourage me to get my life together. I feel like a caged animal that's about to lose its shit because my brain is keeping me from doing things AND my dad is fucking with my shit constantly. I don't have a place I can safely decompress. Putting a gun in my mouth or parking my car on the train tracks and downing a bottle of tequila seem like good life choices compared to this daily fear of having my dad rifle through my stuff and fucking with me while my brain tag teams my suffering.

He's taken this out on me verbally the past 2 days in the form of calls and voicemails. I just, dropping the facade of a well spoken young woman for a second, I'm suffering, I'm in so much pain, everything hurts so badly, I cannot fuckin figure out how to cry out for help. I feel like a carcass all the time. I'm aware that I have a pulse and neural activity and I respirate regularly, biologically speaking, I'm alive. Emotionally, however, I feel like I am filled with rot and decay and nothing. I had no idea what to expect from PTSD, I had no idea that a smell from 13 years ago or the specific clatter that tools make on concrete or a million insignificant things were going to send me into a spiral. I have never been this fragile in my life, everyone kept telling me how lucky I was to be alive when I got home, but I don't feel lucky and I don't feel alive!",depression
74018,"I’m ruining every relationship in my life because I can’t let go of my toxic Mother and I want to end my pain.So, there’s this guy I like-I mean I really like him, he’s been the only one to help me through my sexual assault and he’s the only person in my life who’s genuinely nice to me. My mom is toxic-she controls me financially and emotionally. I always tread on eggshells around her and I’ve had to appease her in order for her to love me. My mom doesn’t like him because he’s poor and she said that she raised me “a certain way”. I love him, but I would probably let him go if she really wanted me to. I’ve already stood up against her by befriending him and she’s cut off my allowance. I was sexually assaulted and my mom blames me for it. She told all her friends about it and deliberately triggers me. She told me it’s my fault for getting sexually assaulted because I was dumb enough to trust someone. She cared more about my grades in university than my rapist beating me and trying to kill me when I didn’t listen to his orders. She said that because of a choice I made, I inconvenienced my whole family. I know my mom is toxic but I’m so fucking stupid because I still love her and would do anything she says. My dad told me to do what makes me happy but how could I be happy with my Friend if my mom hates me?  He doesn’t deserve such a shitty Friend, who would do anything her Mother says. I wish my rapist choked me a little longer so I would’ve died, the bastard almost killed me but he didn’t. I’m such a fucking garbage Friend and Daughter. Here I have a Friend who’s helped me through everything and loved me the way my parents never did but I’m choosing my mom over him. What is wrong with me? I just want my pain to end. I can’t even be with someone I love because I love my toxic Mother, who was totally ok with my grandma abusing me throughout my childhood (my gran raised me) and she gaslights me every single time.",depression
267593,"I don't get why teachers give students to write something multiple times I'm not talking about learning new words in a foreign language. Writing words will help in learning them. But I'm talking about writing a sentence 100 times or writing names and dates. These tasks are of course annoying (at least to me) so the student will probably do them without thinking much, meaning they won't memorize and learn anything. I feel like I could learn more from reading the text 3 times than write it a hundred times. I'll even write it two hundred times if I want. But what's the point? 

Plus, with the power of Internet, there are so many educational sites and encyclopedias that textbooks are **almost** useless. I don't understand why some schools, that have the power to the internet would not use it for education (at least in my school). Plus, if all schools do that, cutting trees for paper for textbooks will be reduced which would be good.",non-depression

187416,"I hate my dad and I am changing my surname when I turn 18 

For almost 6 years, I have been verbally abused by my dad. It's a consistent string of mean things thrown at me for just existing in our house. Tells me if I was better I'd have more friends, I don't result to anything, that I don't have a future and it makes me loathe him.

My mom has been trying to help but it never works. He continues to do this, and I get nervous around him because of his outbursts.

One time he threatened to hit me. Scared out of my 12 year old mind.

I am now 16, a month away from 17. Just a few days ago, I said I didn't want to go run at a track club and instead go to the gym because I figured I'd like to work on more cross fit. There were insults and yelling, and then my sister told me he said he'd kill me, and he came into the basement and as I tried to go upstairs he grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. I told him to stop, he didn't, and I slipped out. I grabbed my charger and my phone and I sprinted into the garage, got my shoes and ran away full speed. I went to my friend's house shaking and we walked around until 1 in the morning, throwing rocks and sitting at the back of the school yard. That night, as we were going back to sleep at his house, I decided I was going to change my last name.

I hate that I have to have the same surname. 

When I get older, people will call me exactly what they called him. I hate him with a burning passion. I've decided that I'm going to change my last name to Kujo when I hit 18, and legally I won't need an adult. I'm disassociating with him. I just can't anymore.",non-depression

I don't really know who I am, and I've never known who I want to be. I'm losing myself. My whole grip on reality has been slowly slipping away for many years, but so much has slipped in the past year. 

Am I depressed? I really see no point in living. Wake up, go to work, go home, and go to bed. Throw in some eating, shopping, and mild forms of entertainment which barely interest me anymore, and that's all life has and will ever be to me. All I ever think about is how to end things, if I feel I've reached the point to do so, and where should I leave this world. I mean, why would I want to go on suffering this life? 

I'm just waiting for something which will finally push me to pull the trigger. Of course, I'd prefer an instant kill switch, but since this overpopulated world thinks inventing that is wrong, I have to choose a more gruesome method. 

I'm fed up with life, with people, with myself. There's no fixing me. No amount of therapy can change this mindset, and anything that could would be blatant brainwashing. I'm just tried of existing. At the point, I'm not slipping away. I've made the choice to let go let the darkness take me. ",depression

 the beginning God created heaven, and earth.2And  the  earth  was  void  and  empty,  anddarkness was upon the face of the deep; and thespirit of God moved over the waters.3And  God  said:  Be  light  made.   And  lightwas made.4And God saw the light that it was good; andhe divided the light from the darkness.5And he called the light Day, and the dark-ness Night; and there was evening and morningone day.6And  God  said:   Let  there  be  a  firmamentmade  amidst  the  waters:  and  let  it  divide  thewaters from the waters.7And  god  made  a  firmament,  and  dividedthe waters that were under the firmament, fromthose that were above the firmament, and it wasso.8And God called the firmament, Heaven; andthe evening and morning were the second day.9God also said; Let the waters that are underthe heaven, be gathered together into one place:and let the dry land appear.  And it was so done.10And God called the dry land, Earth; andthe  gathering  together  of  the  waters,  he  calledSeas.  And God saw that it was good.11And he said: let the earth bring forth greenherb,  and such as may seed,  and the fruit treeyielding fruit after its kind, which may have seedin itself upon the earth.  And it was so done.12And  the  earth  brought  forth  the  greenherb, and such as yieldeth seed according to itskind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seedeach  one  according  to  its  kind.   And  God  sawthat it was good.13And the evening and the morning were thethird day.14And  God  said:  Let  there  be  lights  madein  the  firmament  of  heaven,  to  divide  the  dayand the night, and let them be for signs, and forseasons, and for days and years:15To shine in the firmament of heaven, andto give light upon the earth, and it was so done.16And God made two great lights:  a greaterlight  to rule the  day;  and a  lesser  light to  rulethe night:  and The stars.17And he set them in the firmament of heavento shine upon the earth.18And to rule the day and the night, and todivide the light and the darkness.  And God sawthat it was good.19And  the  evening  and  morning  were  thefourth day.20God also said:  let the waters bring forththe  creeping  creature  having  life,  and  the  fowlthat may fly over the earth under the firmamentof heaven.21And  God  created  the  great  whales,  andevery  living  and  moving  creature,  which  thewaaters brought forth, according to their kinds,and every winged fowl according to its kind. AndGod saw that it was good.4Book of Genesis22And he blessed them, saying:  Increase andmultiply, and fill the waters of the sea:  and letthe birds be multiplied upon the earth.23And the evening and morning were the fifthday.24And God said:  Let the earth bring forththe living creature in its kind, cattle and creepingthings, and beasts of the earth, according to theirkinds.  And it was so done.25And  God  made  the  beasts  of  the  earthaccording  to  their  kinds,  and  cattle,  and  everything that creepeth on the earth after its kind.And God saw that it was good.26And he said: Let us make man to our imageand likeness: and let him have dominion over thefishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and thebeasts, and the whole earth, and every creepingcreature that moveth upon the earth.27And God created man to his own image:to the image of God he created him:  male andfemale he created them.28And  God  blessed  them,  saying:  Increaseand multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it,and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowlsof  the  air,  and  all  living  creatures  that  moveupon the earth.29And  God  said:  Behold  I  have  given  youevery herb bearing seed upon the earth, and alltrees that have in themselves seed of their ownkind, to be your meat:30And to all beasts of the earth, and to everyfowl  of  the  air,  and  to  all  that  move  upon  theearth,  and wherein there is life,  that they mayhave to feed upon.  And it was so done.31And  God  saw  all  the  things  that  he  hadmade, and they were very good. And the eveningand morning were the sixth day.Chapter 2So the heavens and the earth were finished, andall the furniture of them.2And on the seventh day God ended his workwhich he had made: and he rested on the seventhday from all his work which he had done.3And he blessed the seventh day, and sancti-fied it:  because in it he had rested from all hiswork which God created and made.4These are the generations of the heaven andthe  earth,  when  they  were  created,  in  the  daythat  the  Lord  God  made  the  heaven  and  theearth:5And every plant of the field before it sprungup  in  the  earth,  and  every  herb  of  the  groundbefore it grew:  for the Lord God had not rainedupon the earth; and there was not a man to tillthe earth.6But a spring rose out of the earth, wateringall the surface of the earth.7And the Lord God formed man of the slimeof  the  earth:   and  breathed  into  his  face  thebreath of life, and man became a living soul.8And the Lord God had planted a paradise ofpleasure from the beginning:  wherein he placedman whom he had formed.9And  the  Lord  God  brought  forth  of  theground all manner of trees,  fair to behold,  andpleasant  to  eat  of:   the  tree  of  life  also  in  themidst of paradise:  and the tree of knowledge ofgood and evil.10And a river went out of the place of plea-sure to water paradise, which from thence is di-vided into four heads.11The name of the one is Phison:  that is itwhich compasseth all the land of Hevilath, wheregold groweth.12And  the  gold  of  that  land  is  very  good:there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.Book of Genesis513And the name of the second river is Gehon:the  same  is  it  that  compasseth  all  the  land  ofEthiopia.14And the name of the third river is Tigris:the same passeth along by the Assyrians.  Andthe fourth river is Euphrates.15And the Lord God took man, and put himinto the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and tokeep it.16And he commanded him, saying:  Of everytree of paradise thou shalt eat:17But of the tree of knowledge of good andevil, thou shalt not eat.  For in what day soeverthou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.18And the Lord God said:  It is not good forman  to  be  alone:  let  us  make  him  a  help  likeunto himself.19And  the  Lord  God  having  formed  out  ofthe  ground  all  the  beasts  of  the  earth,  and  allthe fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to seewhat he would call them:  for whatsoever Adamcalled any living creature the same is its name.20And  Adam  called  all  the  beasts  by  theirnames, and all the fowls of the air, and all thecattle of the field:  but for Adam there was notfound a helper like himself.21Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep uponAdam: and when he was fast asleep, he took oneof his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.22And the Lord God built the rib which hetook from Adam into a woman: and brought herto Adam.23And Adam said:  This now is bone of mybones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be calledwoman, because she was taken out of man.24Wherefore  a  man  shall  leave  father  andmother,  and  shall  cleave  to  his  wife:  and  theyshall be two in one flesh.25And they were both naked:  to wit, Adamand his wife:  and were not ashamed.Chapter 3Now the serpent was more subtle tha any of thebeasts  of  the  earth  which  the  Lord  God  hadmade.   And  he  said  to  the  woman:  Why  hathGod  commanded  you,  that  you  should  not  eatof every tree of paradise?2And the woman answered him,  saying:  Ofthe fruit of the trees that are in paradise we doeat:3But of the fruit of the tree which is in themidst of paradise, God hath commanded us thatwe should not eat; and that we should not touchit, lest perhaps we die.4And the serpent said to the woman: No, youshall not die the death.5For God doth know that in what day soeveryou shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened:and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.6And the woman saw that the tree was goodto  eat,  and  fair  to  the  eyes,  and  delightful  tobehold:  and  she  took  of  the  fruit  thereof,  anddid eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.7And  the  eyes  of  them  both  were  opened:and when they perceived themselves to be naked,they sewed together fig leaves, and made them-selves aprons.8And when they heard the voice of the LordGod  walking  in  paradise  at  the  afternoon  air,Adam and his wife hid themselves from the faceof the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.9And the Lord God called Adam, and said tohim:  Where art thou?10And he said:  I heard thy voice in paradise;and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hidmyself.11And  he  said  to  him:  And  who  hath  toldthee that thou wast naked,  but that thou hasteaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee thatthou shouldst not eat?  6Book of Genesis12And Adam said:  The woman, whom thougavest me to be my companion, gave me of thetree, and I did eat.13And the Lord God said to the woman: Whyhast  thou  done  this?   And  she  answered:  Theserpent deceived me, and I did eat.14And the Lord God said to the serpent:  Be-cause thou hast done this thing, thou art cursedamong all cattle, and beasts of the earth:  uponthy  breast  shalt  thou  go,  and  earth  shalt  thoueat all the days of thy life.15I  will  put  enmities  between  thee  and  thewoman,  and  thy  seed  and  her  seed:   she  shallcursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for herheel.16To  the  woman  also  he  said:  I  will  multi-ply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions:  in sorrowshalt thou bring forth children,  and thou shaltbe under thy husband’s power, and he shall havedominion over thee.17And to Adam he said:  Because thou hasthearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eatenof the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thoushouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all thedays of thy life.18Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth tothee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat breadtill thou return to the earth out of which thouwast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thoushalt return.20And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:because she was the mother of all the living.21And the Lord God made for Adam and hiswife garments of skins, and clothed them.22And he said:  Behold Adam is become asone of us, knowing good and evil:  now thereforelest perhaps he put forth his hand and take alsoof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.23And the Lord God sent him out of the par-adise of pleasure, to till the earth from which hewas taken.24And he cast out Adam:  and placed beforethe paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flam-ing sword, turning every way, to keep the way ofthe tree of life.Chapter 4And  Adam  knew  Eve  his  wife;  who  conceivedand brought forth Cain, saying:  I have gotten aman through God.2And  again  she  brought  forth  his  brotherAbel.   And  Abel  was  a  shepherd,  and  Cain  ahusbandman.3And it came to pass after many days, thatCain offered,  of the fruits of the earth,  gifts tothe Lord.4Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock,and  of  their  fat:  and  the  Lord  had  respect  toAbel, and to his offerings.5But to Cain and his offerings he had no re-spect:  and  Cain  was  exceeding  angry,  and  hiscountenance fell.6And  the  Lord  said  to  him:  Why  art  thouangry?  and why is thy countenance fallen?7If thou do well, shalt thou not receive?  butif  ill,  shall  not  sin  forthwith  be  present  at  thedoor?  but the lust thereof shall be under thee,and thou shalt have dominion over it.8And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us goforth abroad.  And when they were in the field,Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slewhim.9And  the  Lord  said  to  Cain:  Where  is  thybrother  Abel?   And  he  answered:  I  know  not:am I my brother’s keeper?10And he said to him: What hast thou done?Book of Genesis7the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me fromthe earth.11Now therefore cursed shalt thou be uponthe earth, which hath opened her mouth and re-cieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.12When thou shalt till it,  it shall not yieldto thee its fruit:  a fugitive and a vagabond shaltthou be upon the earth.13And Cain said to the Lord:  My iniquity isgreater than that I may deserve pardon.14Behold thou dost cast me out this day fromthe face of the earth, and from thy face I shall behid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive onthe earth:  every one therefore that findeth me,shall kill me.15And  the  Lord  said  to  him:   No,  it  shallnot  so  be:  but  whosoever  shall  kill  Cain,  shallbe punished sevenfold.  And the Lord set a markupon Cain, that whosoever found him should notkill him.16And  Cain  went  out  from  the  face  of  theLord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at theeast side of Eden.17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,and brought forth Henoch:  and he built a city,and called the name thereof by the name of hisson Henoch.18And  Henoch  begot  Irad,  and  Irad  be-got Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, andMathusael begot Lamech,19Who took two wives:  the name of the onewas Ada, and the name of the other Sella.20And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was thefather of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.21And his brother’s name was Jubal:  he wasthe father of them that play upon the harp andthe organs.22Sella  also  brought  forth  Tubalcain,  whowas  a  hammerer  and  artificer  in  every  work  ofbrass and iron.  And the sister of Tubalcain wasNoema.23And  Lamech  said  to  his  wives  Ada  andSella:  Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hear-ken to my speech:  for I have slain a man to thewounding of myself, and a stripling to my ownbruising.24Sevenfold  vengeance  shall  be  taken  forCain:  but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.25Adam  also  knew  his  wife  again:  and  shebrought forth a son,  and called his name Seth,saying:   God  hath  given  me  another  seed  forAbel, whom Cain slew.26But  to  Seth  also  was  born  a  son,  whomhe called Enos:  this man began to call upon thename of the Lord.Chapter 5This is the book of the generation of Adam.  Inthe day that God created man, he made him tothe likeness of God.2He  created  them  male  and  female;   andblessed  them:  and called  their name  Adam,  inthe day when they were created.3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years,and begot a son to his own image and likeness,and called his name Seth.4And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth,were eight hundred years: and he begot sons anddaughters.5And all the time that Adam lived, came tonine hundred and thirty years, and he died.6Seth also lived a hundred and five years, andbegot Enos.7And  Seth  lived  after  he  begot  Enos,  eighthundred  and  seven  years,  and  begot  sons  anddaughters.

Book of Genesis9row of heart,7He  said:  I  will  destroy  man,  whom  I  havecreated,  from  the  face  of  the  earth,  from  maneven to beasts, from the creeping thing even tothe  fowls  of  the  air,  for  it  repenteth  me  that  Ihave made them.8But Noe found grace before the Lord.9These are the generations of Noe:  Noe wasa  just  and  perfect  man  in  his  generations,  hewalked with God.10And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, andJapheth.11And the earth was corrupted before God,and was filled with iniquity.12And  when  God  had  seen  that  the  earthwas corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its wayupon the earth),13He  said  to  Noe:   The  end  of  all  flesh  iscome before me, the earth is filled with iniquitythrough them, and I will destroy them with theearth.14Make thee an ark of timber planks:  thoushalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shaltpitch it within and without.15And thus shalt thou make it.  The lengthof  the  ark  shall  be  three  hundred  cubits:   thebreadth  of  it  fifty  cubits,  and  the  height  of  itthirty cubits.16Thou shalt make a window in the ark, andin a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it:  and thedoor of the ark thou shalt set in the side:  withlower, middle chambers, and third stories shaltthou make it.17Behold, I will bring the waters of a greatflood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, whereinis the breath of life under heaven. All things thatare in the earth shall be consumed.18And I will establish my covenant with thee,and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thysons,  and  thy  wife,  and  the  wives  of  thy  sonswith thee.19And  of  every  living  creature  of  all  flesh,thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, thatthey  may  live  with  thee:  of  the  male  sex,  andthe female.20Of  fowls  according  to  their  kind,  and  ofbeasts  in  their  kind,  and  of  every  thing  thatcreepeth on the earth according to its kind:  twoof every sort shall go in with thee, that they maylive.21Thou shalt take unto thee of all food thatmay be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee:and it shall be food for thee and them.22And  Noe  did  all  things  which  God  com-manded him.Chapter 7And the Lord said to him:  Go in, thou and allthy house, into the ark:  for thee I have seen justbefore me in this generation.2Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, themale and the female.3But of the beasts that are unclean two andtwo, the male and the female.  Of the fowls alsoof the air seven and seven, the male and the fe-male:  that seed may be saved upon the face ofthe whole earth.4For yet a while, and after seven days, I willrain upon the earth forty days and forty nights:and  I  will  destroy  every  substance  that  I  havemade, from the face of the earth.5And Noe did all things which the Lord hadcommanded him.6And he was six hundred years old, when thewaters of the flood overflowed the earth.7And Noe went in and his sons, his wife andthe wives of his sons with him into the ark, be-10Book of Genesiscause of the waters of the flood.8And  of  beasts  clean  and  unclean,  and  offowls, and of every thing that moveth upon theearth,9Two and two went in to Noe into the ark,male  and  female,  as  the  Lord  had  commandedNoe.10And after the seven days were passed, thewaters of the flood overflowed the earth.11In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe,in the second month, in the seventeenth day ofthe  month,  all  the  fountains  of  the  great  deepwere  broken  up,  and  the  floodgates  of  heavenwere opened:12And the rain fell upon the earth forty daysand forty nights.13In  the  selfsame  day  Noe,  and  Sem,  andCham, and Japheth, his sons:  his wife, and thethree wives of his sons with them, went into theark.14They and every beast according to its kind,and all the cattle in their kind, and every thingthat  moveth  upon  the  earth,  according  to  itskind,  and  every  fowl  according  to  its  kind,  allbirds, and all that fly,15Went in to Noe into the ark, two and twoof all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.16And they that went in, went in male andfemale of all flesh, as God had commanded him:and the Lord shut him in on the outside.17And  the  flood  was  forty  days  upon  theearth:  and  the  waters  increased,  and  lifted  upthe ark on high from the earth.18For they overflowed exceedingly:  and filledall  on  the  face  of  the  earth:   and  the  ark  wascarried upon the waters.19And the waters prevailed beyond measureupon the earth:  and all the high mountains un-der the whole heaven were covered.20The  water  was  fifteen  cubits  higher  thanthe mountains which it covered.21And  all  flesh  was  destroyed  that  movedupon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, andof beasts,  and of all creeping things that creepupon the earth:  and all men.22And all things wherein there is the breathof life on the earth, died.23And  he  destroyed  all  the  substance  thatwas  upon  the  earth,  from  man  even  to  beast,and the creeping things and fowls of the air: andthey  were  destroyed  from  the  earth:   and  Noeonly remained, and they that were with him inthe ark.24And the waters prevailed upon the earth ahundred and fifty days.Chapter 8And  God  remembered  Noe,  and  all  the  livingcreatures, and all the cattle which were with himin the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth,and the waters were abated:2The  fountains  also  of  the  deep,  and  thefloodgates of heaven, were shut up, and the rainfrom heaven was restrained.3And the waters returned from off the earthgoing and coming:  and they began to be abatedafter a hundred and fifty days.4And  the  ark  rested  in  the  seventh  month,the seven and twentieth day of the month, uponthe mountains of Armenia.5And the waters were going and decreasinguntil the tenth month:  for in the tenth month,the first day of the month, the tops of the moun-tains appeared.6And after that forty days were passed, Noeopening  the  window  of  the  ark,  which  he  hadmade, sent forth a raven:Book of Genesis117Which went forth and did not return, till thewaters were dried up upon the earth.8He sent forth also a dove after him, to see ifthe waters had now ceased upon the face of theearth.9But  she  not  finding  where  her  foot  mightrest, returned to him into the ark: for the waterswere upon the whole earth:  and he put forth hishand, and caught her, and brought her into theark.10And  having  waited  yet  seven  other  days,he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.11And she came to him in the evening carry-ing a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, inher mouth.  Noe therefore understood that thewaters were ceased upon the earth.12And he stayed yet other seven days:  andhe sent forth the dove, which returned not anymore unto him.13Therefore  in  the  six  hundredth  and  firstyear, the first month, the first day of the month,the  waters  were  lessened  upon  the  earth,  andNoe opening the covering of the ark, looked, andsaw that the face of the earth was dried.14In the second month, the seven and twen-tieth day of the month, the earth was dried.15And God spoke to Noe, saying:16Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thysons and the wives of thy sons with thee.17All living things that are with thee of allflesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creep-ing things that creep upon the earth, bring outwith  thee,  and  go  ye  upon  the  earth:  increaseand multiply upon it.18So Noe went out, he and his sons:  his wife,and the wives of his sons with him.19And all living things, and cattle, and creep-ing things that creep upon the earth, accordingto their kinds went out of the ark.20And Noe built an altar unto the Lord:  andtaking  of  all  cattle  and  fowls  that  were  clean,offered holocausts upon the altar.21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, andsaid: I will no more curse the earth for the sake ofman:  for the imagination and thought of man’sheart are prone to evil from his youth:  thereforeI will no more destroy every living soul as I havedone.22All the days of the earth, seedtime and har-vest,  cold  and  heat,  summer  and  winter,  nightand day, shall not cease.Chapter 9And  God  blessed  Noe  and  his  sons.    And  hesaid to them:  Increase, and multiply, and fill theearth.2And let the fear and dread of you be uponall the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowlsof the air, and all that move upon the earth:  allthe fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.3And  every  thing  that  moveth,  and  livethshall be meat for you:  even as the green herbshave I delivered them all to you:4Saving that flesh with blood you shall noteat.5For I will require the blood of your lives atthe hand of every beast, and at the hand of man,at the hand of every man, and of his brother, willI require the life of man.6Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his bloodshall be shed:  for man was made to the image ofGod.7But increase you and multiply, and go uponthe earth and fill it.8Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sonswith him:

12Book of Genesis9Behold  I  will  establish  my  covenant  withyou, and with your seed after you:10And with every living soul that is with you,as well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of theearth, that are come forth out of the ark, and inall the beasts of the earth.11I will establish my covenant with you, andall flesh shall be no more destroyed with the wa-ters of a flood, neither shall there be from hence-forth a flood to waste the earth.12And  God  said:   This  is  the  sign  of  thecovenant which I give between me and you, andto every living soul that is with you, for perpet-ual generations.13I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shallbe  the  sign  of  a  covenant  between  me  and  be-tween the earth.14And when I shall cover the sky with clouds,my bow shall appear in the clouds:15And  I  will  remember  my  covenant  withyou,  and  with  every  living  soul  that  bearethflesh:   and  there  shall  no  more  be  waters  of  aflood to destroy all flesh.16And the bow shall be in the clouds, and Ishall see it, and shall remember the everlastingcovenant, that was made between God and everyliving soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.17And  God  said  to  Noe:  This  shall  be  thesign  of  the  covenant,  which  I  have  established,between me and all flesh upon the earth.18And the sons of Noe, who came out of theark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth:  and Chamis the father of Chanaan.19These three are the sons of Noe:  and fromthese  was  all  mankind  spread  over  the  wholeearth.20And Noe a husbandman began to till theground, and planted a vineyard.21And drinking of the wine was made drunk,and was uncovered in his tent.22Which when Cham the father of Chanaanhad seen, to wit, that his father’s nakedness wasuncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.23But  Sem  and  Japheth  put  a  cloak  upontheir shoulders, and going backward, covered thenakedness  of  their  father:  and  their  faces  wereturned  away,  and  they  saw  not  their  father’snakedness.24And Noe awaking from the wine, when hehad learned what his younger son had done tohim,25He said:  Cursed be Chanaan, a servant ofservants shall he be unto his brethren.26And he said:  Blessed be the Lord God ofSem, be Chanaan his servant.27May  God  enlarge  Japheth,  and  may  hedwell in the tents of Sem,  and Chanaan be hisservant.28And  Noe  lived  after  the  flood  three  hun-dred and fifty years.29And  all  his  days  were  in  the  whole  ninehundred and fifty years:  and he died.Chapter 10These  are  the  generations  of  the  sons  of  Noe:Sem, Cham, and Japheth:  and unto them sonswere born after the flood.2The  sons  of  Japheth:  Gomer,  and  Magog,and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch,and Thiras.3And  the  sons  of  Gomer:Ascenez  andRiphath and Thogorma.4And the sons of Javan:  Elisa and Tharsis,Cetthim and Dodanim.5By these were divided the islands of the Gen-tiles  in  their  lands,  every  one  according  to  histongue and their families in their nations. 

Book of Genesis15Chapter 12And  the  Lord  said  to  Abram:  Go  forth  out  ofthy  country,  and  from  thy  kindred,  and  out  ofthy father’s house, and come into the land whichI shall shew thee.2And I will make of thee a great nation, and Iwill bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thoushalt be blessed.3I will bless them that bless thee, and cursethem that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all thekindreds of the earth be blessed.4So Abram went out as the Lord had com-manded  him,  and  Lot  went  with  him:  Abramwas  seventy-five  years  old  when  he  went  forthfrom Haran.5And  he  took  Sarai  his  wife,  and  Lot  hisbrother’s son, and all the substance which theyhad gathered, and the souls which they had got-ten in Haran:  and they went out to go into theland of Chanaan. And when they were come intoit,6Abram passed through the country unto theplace  of  Sichem,  as  far  as  the  noble  vale:  nowthe Chanaanite was at that time in the land.7And the Lord appeared to Abram, and saidto him:  To thy seed will I give this land.  Andhe built there an altar to the Lord, who had ap-peared to him.8And passing on from thence to a mountain,that  was  on  the  east  side  of  Bethel,  he  therepitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, andHai on the east:  he built there also an altar tothe Lord, and called upon his name.9And  Abram  went  forward,  going  and  pro-ceeding on to the south.10And there came a famine in the country:and  Abram  went  down  into  Egypt,  to  sojournthere:  for  the  famine  was  very  grievous  in  theland.11And when he was near to enter into Egypt,he said to Sarai his wife:  I know that thou art abeautiful woman:12And  that  when  the  Egyptians  shall  seethee,  they  will  say:   She  is  his  wife:   and  theywill kill me, and keep thee.13Say,  therefore,  I pray thee,  that thou artmy sister:  that I may be well used for thee, andthat my soul may live for thy sake.14And  when  Abram  was  come  into  Egypt,the Egyptians saw the woman that she was verybeautiful.15And the princes told Pharao, and praisedher before him:  and the woman was taken intothe house of Pharao.16And  they  used  Abram  well  for  her  sake.And  he  had  sheep  and  oxen  and  he  asses,  andmen servants, and maid servants, and she asses,and camels.17But  the  Lord  scourged  Pharao  and  hishouse   with   most   grievous   stripes   for   Sarai,Abram’s wife.18And Pharao called Abram, and said to him:What is this that thou hast done to me?  Whydidst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?19For what cause didst thou say, she was thysister,  that I might take her to my wife?   Nowtherefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thyway.20And Pharao gave his men orders concern-ing Abram:  and they led him away and his wife,and all that he had.Chapter 13And  Abram  went  up  out  of  Egypt,  he  and  hiswife, and all that he had, and Lot with him intothe south.

16Book of Genesis2And he was very rich in possession of goldand silver.3And he returned by the way, that he came,from the south to Bethel, to the place where be-fore he had pitched his tent between Bethel andHai,4In the place of the altar which he had madebefore, and there he called upon the name of theLord.5But  Lot  also,  who  was  with  Abram,  hadflocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.6Neither was the land able to bear them, thatthey  might  dwell  together:  for  their  substancewas great, and they could not dwell together.7Whereupon also there arose a strife betweenthe herdsmen of Abram and of Lot.  And at thattime the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelledin that country.8Abram therefore said to Lot:  Let there beno quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee,and  between  my  herdsmen  and  thy  herdsmen:for we are brethren.9Behold the whole land is before thee: departfrom me, I pray thee:  if thou wilt go to the lefthand,  I  will  take  the  right:  if  thou  choose  theright hand, I will pass to the left.10And  Lot  lifting  up  his  eyes,  saw  all  thecountry  about  the  Jordan,  which  was  wateredthroughout,  before  the  Lord  destroyed  Sodomand Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, andlike Egypt as one comes to Segor.11And Lot chose to himself the country aboutthe Jordan, and he departed from the east:  andthey were separated one brother from the other.12Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan:  andLot abode in the towns, that were about the Jor-dan, and dwelt in Sodom.13And the men of Sodom were very wicked,and sinners before the face of the Lord beyondmeasure.14And  the  Lord  said  to  Abram,  after  Lotwas separated from him:  Lift up thy eyes,  andlook from the place wherein thou now art, to thenorth and to the south,  to the east and to thewest.15All the land which thou seest, I will give tothee, and to thy seed for ever.16And I will make thy seed as the dust of theearth:  if any man be able to number the dust ofthe earth,  he shall be able to number thy seedalso.17Arise  and  walk  through  the  land  in  thelength, and the breadth thereof:  for I will give itto thee.18So  Abram  removing  his  tent,  came,  anddwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron:and he built there an altar to the Lord.Chapter 14And it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel,king  of  Sennaar,  and  Arioch,  king  of  Pontus,and Chodorlahomor,  king of the Elamites,  andThadal, king of nations,2Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, andagainst  Bersa,  king  of  Gomorrha,  and  againstSennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber,king  of  Seboim,  and  against  the  king  of  Bala,which is Segor.3All these came together into the woodlandvale, which now is the salt sea.4For they had served Chodorlahomor twelveyears,  and  in  the  thirteenth  year  they  revoltedfrom him.5And in the fourteenth year came Chodorla-homor, and the kings that were with him:  andthey  smote  the  Raphaim  in  Astarothcarnaim,and the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Saveof Cariathaim.

Book of Genesis176And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir,even  to  the  plains  of  Pharan,  which  is  in  thewilderness.7And they returned,  and came to the foun-tain  of  Misphat,  the  same  is  Cades:  and  theysmote all the country of the Amalecites, and theAmorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.8And the king of Sodom, and the king of Go-morrha,  and  the  king  of  Adama,  and  the  kingof Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor,went out:  and they set themselves against themin battle array, in the woodland vale:9To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of theElamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Am-raphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pon-tus:  four kings against five.10Now the woodland vale had many pits ofslime.   And  the  king  of  Sodom,  and  the  kingof Gomorrha turned their backs, and were over-thrown  there:  and  they  that  remained,  fled  tothe mountain.11And  they  took  all  the  substance  of  theSodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their vict-uals, and went their way:12And Lot also, the son of Abram’s brother,who dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.13And  behold  one,  that  had  escaped,  toldAbram  the  Hebrew,  who  dwelt  in  the  vale  ofMambre  the  Amorrhite,  the  brother  of  Escol,and  the  brother  of  Aner:   for  these  had  madea league with Abram.14Which when Abram had heard, to wit, thathis brother Lot was taken,  he numbered of theservants  born  in  his  house,  three  hundred  andeighteen,  well appointed:  and pursued them toDan.15And dividing his company, he rushed uponthem in the night, and defeated them:  and pur-sued them as far as Hoba,  which is on the lefthand of Damascus.16And he brought back all the substance, andLot his brother, with his substance, the womenalso, and the people.17And the king of Sodom went out to meethim,  after  he  returned  from  the  slaughter  ofChodorlahomor, and of the kings that were withhim in the vale of Save, which is the king’s vale.18But Melchisedech, the king of Salem, bring-ing forth bread and wine, for he was the priestof the most high God,19Blessed him, and said:  Blessed be Abramby the most high God, who created heaven andearth.20And  blessed  be  the  most  high  God,  bywhose protection, the enemies are in thy hands.And he gave him the tithes of all.21And  the  king  of  Sodom  said  to  Abram:Give me the persons, and the rest take to thyself.22And he answered him:  I lift up my handto the Lord God the most high, the possessor ofheaven and earth,23That  from  the  very  woofthread  unto  theshoe latchet,  I will not take of any things thatare thine, lest thou say:  I have enriched Abram.24Except such things as the young men haveeaten, and the shares of the men that came withme, Aner, Escol, and Mambre:  these shall taketheir shares.Chapter 15Now when these things were done, the word ofthe  Lord  came  to  Abram  by  a  vision,  saying:Fear  not,  Abram,  I  am  thy  protector,  and  thyreward exceeding great.2And Abram said:  Lord God, what wilt thougive  me?   I  shall  go  without  children:  and  theson of the steward of my house is this DamascusEliezer.",non-depression

287896,"The worst part.Today something very bad happened to me.  I can't go into the details because there's legal stuff up in the air and I don't want anyone to recognize who I am.

I have fantasized about suicide my entire life.  It is my escape, to know that I could end it if I chose to.  I've never tried, but I've always wanted to.  I want so bad to be back where I was before I came into existence.  Not sad or even happy but just, not.  I want it so bad.  I want it now more than ever in light of todays events. 

My problem is that I have a fiance now and I'd feel guilty doing that to her.  The worst part about this love I've found is that I'm no longer free to off myself.

So I sit here now, razor sharp knife in hand, and I am stuck.  I know I'm physically capable of doing this.  I've already drank enough to manage the pain of the cutting.  I know I could go deep with this knife and really get in that vein and I could be over before long.  I want that, but I can't leave her.  She's asleep in the other room and she has no idea what's going on.

123575,"To all of you considering ending it allHi. I just want to repeat the immortal words of Luke Skywalker: I care.

I really do. I, myself, have sought help in SW. I also regularly comment here to try to be there for others who, like me, want to end their lives for some reason or another.

My hand to God, if I could find a way to get to your town and just sit down and have a drink with you and give you a hug and do nothing more than be there with you so that you know you're not alone, I would. Hell, if I were wealthy, I'd fly to your town just to sit with you and help you feel less alone.

I've read many of your posts. Some of you feel like you've just made too many mistakes. Some of you feel like the odds are stacked too highly against you. Some of you feel like the pain is just too much to bear. I am one of those who has suffered a pain too strong to forget. But in considering my own end, I've realized that, although my own life seems to be too much to abide, I would give it all up to be there for *you*.

I would. I'm tired of being me. I'm absolutely sick of it. But—instead of giving up my life to death—I'd rather give my life up, bit by bit, in being there for all of you.

I don't know you. I really don't. And I can't even begin to understand what some of you are going through. I know that. But, nonetheless, I would prefer to use my life to do something, anything within my power, for some fellow sufferer rather than take my life.

And I hope you can take this as encouragement. Someone else passed this lesson on to me a long time ago. If you ever feel like you're at the end of your life and you just don't feel like you can live anymore, think of this perspective: There are others out there who, like you, despair of their own existence. How wonderful would it be to be the kind of person to them that you would like to see in your own life? Rather than thinking of killing yourself, think like this: ""If I want my own life to end, what can I do before I snuff out my life forever to be of assistance to someone suffering like myself?""

You might want your own life to be over. I can identify with that. But, if (as you think) your life is as good as finished, what little things could you do before the end to relieve the suffering of others who have also, like you, had a difficult life?

I first came to SW seeking help. I've been through some truly awful things, and I've been hating being me. But while I was here, I found others who were similarly suffering. I began to post, with my usual account, in various other sufferers' threads. I realized that *being* that light (the light that I want to see in my own life) was about as good as feeling it myself. That is, I found that by helping others, I was being the thing that I wanted to experience myself.

Let me explain it this way: I was seriously considering taking my own life. I wanted help—relief—but I hadn't experienced it. I figured that I might as well (since I was just about ready to give up my own life) be there for others who were also suffering.

So, what I recommend is what has helped me to work through my own problems. Be that which you want to see in the world. Do you want relief and succor? Be that for someone else. Do you want justice and mercy? Be just and merciful. After all, you've considered taking your own life—what would it hurt to show some camaraderie and try to help others who have fallen on hard times?

I mean, think of it this way: You want to kill yourself? Well, take a little time, before you end your life forever, to give of yourself for someone else who also feels an overwhelming pain. You may find that life *is*, after all, meaningful. It's worked for me. If you really feel like you're at your end, what would it hurt to take just a little more time to try it?

With all love, respect, and kinship— 
A fellow sufferer",depression

I have problems inside my head I think, and then problems outside my head and all I can really conclude here is maybe I’m too lazy to fix them or maybe they were never meant to be fixed? I’m just so overwhelmed with everything and I just hate being an adult (I’m 22). 

I’m supposed to be figuring out college, how to get insurance because I can’t be on either of my parents, how to save money. I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong with and why I think certain ways, get angry or upset or think there’s signs directed to me or whatever. I’m trying to figure out how to have energy to do anything at all. I work and after I work I can’t do anything else. I always think I deserve a day off but I don’t. I take 4 classes; it was 5 but I dropped out of one. And I am 3 weeks behind on all my homework. I don’t even know where the time goes I guess I just sleep I really don’t know. 

I only work 3 days a week which is a little under $200 paycheck and my friend who doesnt go to school makes me feel like shit and always asks me to go places and I just don’t know what is wrong with her as to why they don’t understand why I have no money. My dad has no money so I’ve had a lot of things that I needed to pay. My mom is retired and I don’t ask her for money anyways because I genuinely feel no connection with her and it is the worst feeling in the world. 

People just don’t like me either. I don’t know what I do wrong I know I am awkward but I’ve never been mean.. I don’t know. I just kind of mind my business most of the time and I can’t fake being someone I’m not... and so I just don’t talk to that many people I guess.

My father died when I was a child, and of my siblings, I'm the closest to my mother.  I'm in my late twenties and still living at home with her because I took care of her when she was sick/I was in school, and she took care of me after I had major surgery.  I commute to a job an hour away in a dead small town, and all of my friends moved away to the nearest big city. I haven't moved out of my house because I don't feel secure enough in my job to commit elsewhere financially. I can't find a job in the area where all of my friends are, and even if I did, I think my fear of changing and ending up somewhere worse would scare me off.

I have a fair amount of friends, but I'm lonely and don't think I'll ever find someone to share my life with. I don't know who would want to anyway, I'm self-conscious, terrified of everything and don't think I'm attractive enough for anyone.  Guys mostly want to be just friends with me and that's it, or if they date/are in a relationship with me they end up leaving me and move on to greener pastures.  I've been single for almost five years now and I'm tired of the aching loneliness and the inevitable sting of rejection when I try to fill it. (Edit: I did have a relationship with I guy I thought I'd be with forever.  He left me and there has been no one since.  I've known great love, so I know exactly what I'm missing.)

I don't find joy in anything anymore. I've tried living, tried to improve my life and work towards a better future, but every time I try I fail, and it's wearing me down.  Every day is agony to me.  I cant enjoy the brief moments of happiness that come my way because I know they won't last. I've done therapy, medications, exercise, healthy eating, affirmations, more socializing, new hobbies, traveling, everything and anything that has been prescribed or suggested to me.  Nothing is making living less painful for me. The only tangible relief I get comes from self-harming, which makes me feel like a pathetic cliché and garbage person,  not to mention it broke my mother's heart when she found out I was doing it.

My entire life I've been chasing this singular moment in time - A moment of weakness, portrayed to someone who loves me, and to realize that I wasn't entirely alone for once. I guess I just never got that.

I really didn't want it to come to this. I tried to get away from it. I asked Karen for help, and she was happy to help me. But I can't open up easily, and I can't just start talking to someone about what's been on my mind quickly. Before I had a chance to, my roommate showed up and we weren't alone anymore, and she didn't realize what was going on in my head, that I needed to talk to her privately and tell her what was happening to me.

Jessica, I guess the 10 missed calls tomorrow morning isn't going to make you feel innocent in all this. I really don't think you could have helped me anyway, though, so don't feel guilty for not waking up to answer me. I can't tell you anything more than that.

Karen, I'm glad I finally saw you, for real. It always felt so strange that the only friend I could talk to about anything, I had never met in person before. You were always the closest thing I ever had to a friend I could trust, but in the end that wasn't what I needed. I'm sorry about that picture of your butt.

Sandra, I wish we didn't drift apart so much. I understand why. It was always sort of awkward between us after... I'm sorry if I hurt you. You're happy now and I hope that never changes.

Chris and James - you're the only men on this list. Maybe that should tell you just how close of friend you were to me. I don't think I'll need to say any more than that to make my point.

And lastly, Elizabeth, I don't know how you feel about me anymore. But I want you to know that this isn't your fault. I know that you'll feel like it was, because I've been there too. But you can't blame yourself - I don't blame you for a single thing that happened between us, in the end. I was the problem - and we should have just stayed friends. You're an amazing person, and maybe if I'd been able to see that you were just trying to be happy, I wouldn't have been so selfish. I'm so sorry for what happened.

I'll see her again. It's pointless of me to ask you to not be sad. I at least hope one of you care enough to realize what led up to this, but I haven't felt like anyone has really cared in a long time.",depression

I am home by yself while everyone else is out partying, for weeks now I've been in a state of near constant high anxiety, its unrelenting, and for months and months I've been completely unable to feel anything approaching enjoyment in anything I do. My vision is blurred, I have physical pains that have no root cause all over, my skin hurts for no reason whatsoever and my muscles are very stiff and click/creak a lot.

Past month of so Iv'e had very strong very convincing thoughts of suicide (its more like my brain is not under my control and is telling me to do this, over and over again, forces me to listen to it i cant block it out), with a very specific method in mind. I have a very long length of Cat-5 cable I plan to double up for strength, tie around my neck and jump off my balcony.

307497,"On the topic of humour Back story: I posted a 9/11 meme on discord and someone got offended. So I took it down and apologized.

So, here's what I think, humour is a selective thing. What I mean by that is, you might find something offensive or not funny, but someone else might. So, something like a 9/11 meme is hella funny to me but probably not to you. And I don't care if you get offended because that shit kills me. So, you not liking a joke I make doesn't mean it's not a good joke. For example (I didn't make this joke): How many cops does it take to screw a lightbulb? None, they just beat the room for being black. Now, I'm black and some people might think that the joke is offensive, but that shit is funny as hell. The thing about jokes is that there is no such thing as an appropriate joke. Most, if not all, jokes have their dark side. So, for you to say a joke is not okay is wrong. What you should say is that ""I don't like that joke because I get offended by that kind of humor"". So, stop getting all mad and stuff just because a joke isn't to your liking because nine times out of ten, the person telling the joke won't give a fuck or will laugh at you for being soft.

Then there's 1927 by [Gene Austin](https://youtu.be/S-HoFhLRuO4) and boy is the tone so much different. Also [Roger Wolfe Kahn](https://youtu.be/ctqlO_aeRUk) which is crackly and has a different tone. Now were in the 1952 with [Frankie Laine](https://youtu.be/nZ1x_dDiQ8o) which has a chorus and sung much louder. Next were on [Patience &amp; Prudence](https://youtu.be/fOjVjc5vJ6I) 1956 which sounds like how I know the song. But were not done this song has more history. Still 1956 [Lawrence Well with The Lennon Sisters](https://youtu.be/n8bmXG4MtPI) it sounds close to the one I know, but different. The history continues now by [George Maharis](https://youtu.be/iX_tV46D9NY) 1964 sounds close to the one I know just its a duo now. Now onto [Dottie West](https://youtu.be/iW8xG-LRSgk) the tone is more joyful and has chorus of men in the background.  And thats the history of this song sorry I'm bored and looked into this and wanted to share. Sorry I'm bad at describing songs tones and stuff so I tagged all the versions of this song as I listed them.",non-depression

Everyday, I'm reminded of how worthless and stupid I am. She even told to kill myself once. And I've tried to talking to my friends about how my parents make me feel, but all I get is ""aren't all parents like that lmao"" and it makes me feel like I'm overreacting. It feels like no matter what I say or what I do, I'll just be looked down on as some edgy, rebellious, ungrateful teenager going through a phase.

259254,"Hey guys check out this cool beast monster that I wrote about for a future animated series/manga my friend and I are planning The Intellectual is a giant, 8-armed biological colossal fusion composed of the souls of Leo, Steven, Saul and Carlos. 

Despite his crude demeanor and destructive nature, The Intellectual has conscience of what happens around him, and has the intelligence to strategize, rationalize and restrain himself from being reckless under his surroundings.

In his standard combat mode, The Intellectual can perform varios combos using his Determination blade and Symbiote limbs. He can also attack from long range using his comically upscaled pistol, allowing him to shoot Symbiote bullets which kill and paralyze most enemies on sight. 

If given enough time, The Intellectual can also let out a roaring screech, causing a shockwave that usually dazes his opponents for a short amount of time. Once stunned, he often adds onto the ambush by latching onto the enemy, biting into them with his many rows of sharp teeth.

The Intellectual has a powerful long-range move that can completely vaporize the enemy if left untreated. The Diocesano symbol plastered on his chest can begin to light up various colors. Once this happens, The Intellectual will stand still as he charges up his attack. Once ready, The Intellectual will launch a full force, enormous green beam with a multi-colored red, yellow and purple aura, damaging anything in its path.

As an ultimate move, The Intellectual can preform a Dark Piercing Mouth Impale, combining all his weapons to form a shotgun, launching a Symbiote net towards the enemy, trapping them and paralyzing them completely. Once entangled in this net, a giant black sword with a red aura will appear behind the enemy, impaling them from behind, extracting anything from the inside out through the mouth. 

It is also worth noting that The Intellectual can only remain intact for no longer than 15 minutes, due to him being a tank of energy that Steven cannot withhold for long. His strongest attack, such as his beam and ultimate move, reduces the amount of time he has left by 8 minutes.",non-depression

337583,"Swallowed by GriefMy life has fallen apart. Things started going downhill back in Fall of 2009. I was 15 and began to develop an eating disorder and it completely took over my life. I lost all my friends and isolated myself from my family. My mother really tried to get me to talk to her, but I felt I couldn't. I regret that now. I lost a lot of weight, but it quickly transformed into a way for me to cope with my depression.

The following summer in July 2010, my father died. I hadn't seen or heard from him in two years, so it crushed me. He was never the fatherly type, but I'd always hoped that one day we could have that bond and be close. I leaned on my eating disorder even more to cope with the loss. Despite this, I was trying to be more social at school, and made friends again, but it was hard for me to get close to people. It still is.

8 months after my father died, my mother, brother, and I went to a family get together at my uncle's house. When we got home my mother called my brother and I into the kitchen, and told us she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. It was caught early and she would begin chemo the following week. It was my worst fear come true. Everything changed. I was 16 at this time, and my mother began to become very weak from chemo and I was her caretaker. By summer 2011, she had a mastectomy, and was in the hospital for a long time. I did everything I could to help her when she came home. I cleaned her surgical wounds, helped her bathe, get dressed, use the restroom, and anything else she needed. I've never talked to anyone about what I was feeling or how this was affecting me, I just leaned on my eating disorder, but it was taking a toll on me. I started having bad chest pains and heart palpitations, but I kept this to myself and I tried to recover on my own.

My mom got better, was cancer free, and healthy. By this point I was a senior in high school. Things had started to go back to normal. I was focused on graduating, prom, getting into college, and really pulling the reins in on my eating disorder so I could start a new life without it in college. My senior year was great, and I got into my first choice university. We spent the summer getting ready for my move into my dorm. It was bittersweet, but I was excited for a new beginning with everything that had happened.

It was 2012, and my freshmen year was starting off strong. I didn't let food, weight, or any insecurities hold me back. I made friends, I actually hung out with them, we went to events on campus, and I had fun. I had a social life, which is something I've spent most of my life without.

November of the same year, mother and brother came to visit me. We went out to eat, they met my friends, and we had a good time. It was getting towards the time for them to start heading back home, and then my mother told us she went to the doctor. Her breast cancer had come back. It was caught early just like the last time. She was hopeful, but I was still scared. I was in shock. I wanted things to be good again and went into denial. In the second half of my freshmen year I relapsed into my eating disorder, started having really bad insomnia, regular breakdowns, and started isolating myself again.

My first year of college came to an end, and I was happy to finally go home for summer. This was in 2013. When I got home she was very sick. I found out she never went to treatment. She refused it. Which meant she was going to die. I couldn't accept it. How could I accept living without my mom? Without parents? I was 19. I knew nothing about being an adult, or living life without my mother by my side. That June she left her job permanently, and her coworkers threw her a party so they could say goodbye. She entered hospice, and I took care of her again, but it was a lot harder this time. She had a hospital bed moved into her bedroom, had an oxygen machine, and tons of meds to control her pain levels. Dozens of family and friends came to visit with her.

I became very stressed. Even though there were a lot of people over, I was left to do most things on my own. I was doing everything I had to do before, but I also was keeping track of her medications and when she needed to take them, I cleaned her tumors, I cooked her meals, and was up with her most nights because it was hard for her to sleep. I was happy to help, but I felt very strained. If my brother wasn't at work, he was in his room or out with friends. It bothered me because she's his mom too, but i bit my tongue and let it go. Some of my aunts noticed how tired I was and started helping me, and letting me take naps, but usually I'd just go to my room and breakdown. Everything was changing and there was no going back this time. 

Some coworkers of my mother's pooled some money together for a trip for 3 to a spa resort. A mother, one of her sisters, and I all went and it was really nice. My mom really had a good time, I took a lot of pictures, made some really nice memories. We got back from the trip and by this point the summer was dwindling to an end, and it was time for me to head back to college. I wanted to stay, but she told me to go and that no matter what happens I should finish my degree. Then she had a real talk with me about how things were going to be, and that she wouldn't live long enough to see me graduate and other things. I kissed her a bunch of times, hugged her even more, and told her i love her, then it was time for me to go. That was the last time I ever saw her. She died less than week later. I talked to her over the phone two days before she died, and the last thing we said to each other was ""See you later."" I had no idea that would be the last time. I should have told her I loved her, and I've beat myself up over it for a long time.

We were forced to sell the house because we couldn't afford it, and now my brother and I stay in a small two bedroom apartment. It'll be 3 years since her death this August. My brother just turned 26 and I'll be 23 in a few months. He's moved on. He has a girlfriend, tons of friends, and a career. He has a life. I'm still in college and am almost done, but I'm completely isolated. I don't talk to anyone. I've gone back to self destructive ways and solitude. I'm currently home for summer, but I'll be leaving again next month back to college. College has become a place of immense dread.

Emotionally, I'm still the 19 year old girl that lost her mom. I'm stuck. I completely shut down after she died, and I don't know how to let go and move on. It's crushed me. So now I'm in this hole engulfed in grief, in the dark, by myself, and I don't know what to do. I need my mom. I'm going through the hardest thing in my life and I can't talk to her. My life has fallen apart. Life has been beating me down since 2009 and it's finally won. I've gone down this road before a couple tines, but i don't think I can bounce back from this one.",depression

276629,"Not going into 2016So its been a hard year for me, not going into too much detail but i've tried killing myself several times and each time i was saved before i was done and had to deal with police/ambulance showing up at my house and taking me to the Mental health ward at the local hospital followed by me spitting bullshit about how i wont do it again to leave.

I come from an Italian family and I'm 21. They still are very protective which limits my happiness in life. For the past year I have smoked weed everyday to ""try"" to forget all the bad, but the weed always runs out and when it does, nothing makes me happy.

I had the world in 2013. At the end of high school i weighed 135kg, got down to 75kg in 3 months (no joke) was on a local news show in Australia. I felt like i was finally in tune with the rest of the world, going out making friends getting girls. I started training hard at gym and wound up 95kg (did one cycle of steroids) at 10-12% body fat. So any gym junkies would know that i would have had an amazing physique - thus 2013 was the best year of my life, i was happy. 2014/2015 were hard, i crashed my car leaving me with no car and insurance money. Started gambling and smoking weed, stopped going gym, leaving me at 90kg with atleast 20% body fat and a body that im ashamed of. Now its almost 2016, i have no friends, no one who loves me and there hasnt been a day i havent had to face endless screaming and being put down by my family this year and its taking its toll on me. I just want to be safe in the sky.

-Nothing making me happy

393,"I think I'm done.I see no point in continuing my life. It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.

I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.

Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.

This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.

Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, never have to feel a thing again. I want to be free from the tyranny of sadness and depression, free from the cage of anxiety and panic.

30444,"My Sister almost died in June - and I almost didn't give a shit Which makes me feel sick. I don't really hate my sister. I don't love her but I don't really love anyone :). In Anycase.. my story..

Sister passes out at my home with family and I am the only one calm enough to call 999 (UK) We didn't know it at the time but she had miscarried

Skipping forward 6 hours later..

This may have been the trigger in that it’s when I found out I wasn’t feeling things I should’ve. When I walked into the ICU after a 4 hour surgery I saw her lying in the bed attached to a dozen machines. She was a completely different colour – she was almost chalk white like a ghost with some yellow in there too. It was almost like she was already dead ever though she was awake and her eyes were moving around (not talking much.) Whenever she would look at me I would automatically start looking concerned and happy that she was ok.. smiling.. being my normal self by taking the mick out of her and calling her a druggy (she kept pressing the morphine drip every 5 seconds!!) but when she would look away I would just go back to normal and my facial expressions would stop.. until she needed me to look concerned again. 

At the time we obviously never knew how close she was to dying. Apparently the surgeon “shat himself” when she came in as he was sure she was going to die – he had never successfully operated on someone who’s haemoglobin count was so low – I checked online and it was then I realise how close it was. Apparently if we were 15minutes late then..  (Haemoglobin level of 2.6 or something like that - she was told she will be in the medical journal! ha)

My sheer lack of emotion at this and matched with my consistent suicidal thoughts and nightmares involving death including me dying over many years are.. I don't know.. starting to get a bit much for me. I seriously fucking hate myself for thinking these things above. I am kinda seeing a counsillor at the moment but am not finding it useful at all and I am not sure what is going on in my stupid head. ",depression
35726,"Got in trouble for my resting face when I was in grade 8 (story) This is pretty long but I figured people would find this somewhat interesting. Typed this pretty quickly so sorry for spelling errors and such. 

Im now in grade 11 and have been 4 schools in total. I know for a fact that where this story comes from is actually the worst school I have ever been apart of. 

So every year we had this thing that was pretty common among schools. Typically near the last block or 2 of the day a basketball game was organized (teachers vs students)  and all of the grade 6, 7, and 8 students were invited to watch. I always thought that being there was pretty shitty especially because sports dont interest me much and I was always behind in grade 8 so it pissed me off a little that I wasn't allowed to stay behind and work on some due assignments. 

So one year in particular a friend of mine was on their phone beside me looking at memes awhile trying to show me. We weren't supposed to have our phones (for whatever reason) and so I was a bit nervous he would get caught. I told him to make a better effort in hiding it so he doesn't get the thing taken away from him and he does try at first to make it less obvious but subconsciously went back to being on it causally. 

I had my drawing book with me at the time (I was only allowed to have it because it helped with anxiety) and was sketching something. Suddenly I heard a teacher from the bottom of the bleachers say ""put your shit away!"" (Wasnt uncommon in this school for teachers to cus but if a kid did it you got sent home) and thinking she was talking to me, I looked up  and glanced at the teacher. I realized she was talking to my friend and so went back to drawing. 

I look back up again not even 2 minutes later and see shes suddenly staring at me. A bit freaked out I tried going back to drawing but I was aware of the teacher watching me in the corner of my eye. Suddenly I heard my name being called by her. I didnt think I was on trouble so I came down smiling and asked her what was up. She told me to sit at the front of the bleachers and the fallowing conversation happend, 

Me: huh? Why? 

Teach: You were glaring at me. Do you understand how rude that is!? 

Me: glaring?? I looked at you for a second thinking you were talking to me earlier! 

I got pretty defensive and we went back and forth. I kept trying to tell her its my resting face, and I can look pretty intense when drawing even a simple sketch because im focused. She refused to believe me and instead sent me to the office for ""making excuses"".  

I go without question and she doesn't fallow after me right away. When I arrive there the office lady asked me why I was sent there and I attempted to explain my unfair situation. But before she could respond the teacher who sent me there showed back up and grabbed my wrist borderline throwing me into an empty office just to yell at me. 

We loudly went back and forth. Through I was trying not to yell I still kinda did since I was starting to panic after being yelled at for somthing I can't really control. Not to mention that I have anxiety ticks that caused me to start twitching while agruing which only got her more mad and accused me for faking and trying to get out of the situation without apologizing. Eventually I scream ""I'm sorry"" and ask her if I can finally leave. Yet she doesn't let me because my apology ""wasn't a real apology"". 

She then threatened to call my mother if I didn't give her a proper and calm response detailing why I apparently glared at her and to stop twitching.

I saw an opportunity to get out of the situation so I continued to refuse forcing her to call my mom hoping my mom could somehow help. It only got worse from there as she tried telling my mom I glared at her after she told me to put my phone away. That was a mistake to say since I didn't have a phone with me and that it was still in my moms car which she happened to be in during the call. My mom told her this information and asked if shes sure I glared and didn't just have a resting bitch face. 

Seriously this went on forever, the teacher continued to agrue with her as if she knew me better saying that she taught my grade 6 class and that she ""knew that look"". my mom eventually had enough and told her she was going to pick me up from school and to let me get my stuff together. She tried keeping me there but an office lady who could hear the teacher on the phone (by listening using the other phone in the office) told her she legally wasn't allowed and to let me get my stuff together.

I see no future, no purpose, I don't know what I'll do when my parents die. I hope I'm not going to go as far as suicide, but I keep thinking of hypothetical situations where I'm in mortal peril, and I just give in.

I decided to stop that cycle last week, and forced myself to eat, and stay up and work on my projects. It got me up, a lot. I spoke to a friend and we talked until I broke down crying, and that cleaned me up a bit. I'm trying to turn my shit around and go back to jolly old me.

I’ve made a lot of friends on there and it’s a different pain knowing I’ll never play with them again because of my older sister who used to find my best worlds and delete them. 
I made a world in 2016. I spawned on an island. I made a hotel so high it reached the limit. I had hundreds of massive houses all in a line with backyards. I improved the village. I added public bathrooms with working toilets. I made colourful,unique buildings and they were stores or cafes or pubs or orphanages,pools,fisherman places,a school,Aquariums,hospitals,police stations with German Shepard, I had cat/dog/ferret/hamster/parakeet and parrot cafes. Adoption centers,customized banners with countries,lgbt flags,a zoo, large bridges that lead to the ice biome so you could look above the polar bears. Farms that were huge. A witch castle. An ikea with furniture. I made my own texture pack and it was beautiful.

So when I got kicked off and went back on,only to find myself in survival,my inventory empty and in the middle of the ocean, I felt awful.

I had a graveyard with the names of my old Minecraft friends so I’d never forget them,since I have severe memory issues. A huge piece of my childhood just got ripped out. I got attached to that world. I had a section dedicated to little memories of my childhood. I made it because I’ve forgotten my whole childhood except for the bad things so I made the section because then at least I’d be able to remember some of it.

234774,"Katy Perry Gush :) ***hey guys, gals, and non binary pals :)***

so I'm bored and listening to music and I've recently started listening to some old Katy Perry songs that came out back when I was little. anddddd I have quite a lot to say about them. :) nobody probably cares tho lol. but basically, I'm just gonna be gushing about her songs and lyrics cuz why not? if you're not interested, you can keep scrolling and ignore this lol. I'm open to having a discussion or gush afterwards in the comments if you end up reading my post. either way, hope you all have a great rest of your day/night! :)

so to begin: I absolutely love how the majority of her songs are about empowering women and just so motivational. I feel like I've always been strong or known my worth, so I was able to relate to her songs. and then other songs are just really fun! no big message or anything, just for fun! NOW LET US BEGINNN

**PART OF ME:** basically about how she's leaving her cheating bf according to the music video and talking about how life and people can be really crappy at times, but you shouldn't let them get the best of you. those people are miserable and sad which is why they try to make YOU sad and miserable. I personally can relate cuz I've been hurt... quite a few times throughout life by many people and honestly find it really hard to trust people now. but no matter how badly they've hurt me, I always, *always* bounce back because I know my worth and know that no matter how much they try to cut me down, they can't. nothing they can say can make me forget myself and my own worth, and I know that truly happy and good people don't try to cut others done or make them feel bad about themselves. whoever does anything like that is NOT truly happy with themselves or their lives. I mean, c'mon. do you really think someone who is perfectly healthy, happy, and good will try to make others miserable? **no.** I also know that if nobody else is there for me, I know I have my family to support me and motivate me. due to these reasons, I absolutely love this song :)

**HOT N COLD:** this one is another motivational song! I loved this song ever since I was little as well because of the empowering message in it. in the music video, Katy is getting married to someone but he gets cold feet. the song is about a toxic relationship, how one person doesn't want the person, but doesn't want the person to want someone else either, or is constantly changing their minds. the relationship started out great but started deteriorating. another thing I really liked was the lyrics that go like 'I should know that you're no good for me' and 'I should know that you're not gonna change'. I liked those because I feel it shows how in toxic relationship, people hardly ever change so it's honestly pointless to stay in those relationships. I know it's easier said than done to leave those relationships, so I'm not shaming anyone for staying in those cuz I know many people try to leave but can't. as I mentioned before, I've always known my worth so this song was motivating for me because when I date in the future, I know that I won't take anybody's crap. I know my worth and know that I deserve to be treated with respect, and I'll treat my S.O with respect, and the minute someone treats me badly or thinks that they can walk all over me, I'm out without a backwards glance. why should I waste my time on someone who doesn't respect me? there are plenty of people out there who will respect me, so I'm not gonna stay hung up on someone who doesn't. k *that* turned into a rant lol, sorry. basically, I found it really motivating and loved the lyrics :)

**LAST FRIDAY NIGHT (TGIF):** i looove this song lol. it's not motivational or anything, it's one of those 'just-for-fun' songs and I sing and dance along every single time. also, her voice sounds amazing in this song lol. i love dancing and the concept of parties, which I unfortunately haven't spent a lot of time at in my short 15 years of life :/ tho I do plan on attending many, many parties as I grow older haha. anyways, the song is just really fun and while the music video is quite crazy lol, I love it regardless and I can't wait till I'm older to have fun and be more independent as I have pretty strict parents who don't let me do a lot of things. that's another reason why I love the song: it gives me hope and makes me excited about the years to come once I get into college and am more independent. to sum that all up, loveee it lol

**CALIFORNIA GURLS:** ok, so this song doesn't have any meaning behind it really either, but I just always loved it ever since I was little... before I understood that the entire song was basically about sex and was full of sexual references O.O I just loved it because I'm from the state the song is about so I felt very proud and famous when I was little cuz the song was about where I lived lol. besides that, I just like the beat and think it's a fun song! :)

k those are all the songs haha. Like I said, I was bored and felt like writing about the songs cuz why not? and also, my family is most likely tired of hearing this gush lol so I'm turning to Internet strangers :)

279676,"Back and Forth with Suicidal ThoughtsHi,

&amp;#x200B;

Every year I feel like I go through such an intensive phase where I want to die. It's exhausting, no one ever checks up on me and the one person who made me feel okay (my childhood best friend) rarely texts me. The one person who would make me feel valid and worth living is the same person that promises to stay and leaves me to fight for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that he is under no obligation to babysit me and I don't want that, I just want to feel like people take in what I say, not some comedic relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I have never went to a psychologist, I attempted to go to a GP Doctor and he started smiling when I told him about how I feel and I felt stupid after that, I would talk to counsellors as well and they spewed the same ""painting helps"" bullshit, the same tired faces with a forced smile.

&amp;#x200B;

I know no one **has** to do things I want them to do but it'd be a nice change to hear someone genuinely say ""How are you?""

Half an hour before I was meant to meet with him, he messages me and says he can't and he has other plans. I was so upset about this. Most people would probably think I am over reacting but I was actually planning to surprise him and take him out for lunch, my treat. I'm staring to get really busy with exams and will be for another week and in two weeks today, i'm going to Japan. So really, I don't have much time left to spend with him. So I got pretty upset about this and naturally go back to thoughts about me wanting to hurt/kill myself. I always go back to thinking it's my fault but is it my fault?

tldr; Going to surprise boyfriend by taking him out for lunch, told me he had other plans half an hour before we were going to meet. Can't spend much time with him as I have exams and going overseas soon (hence surprise lunch) and now I feel like hurting/killing myself

149932,"Advice about boys from a boy 3: Tokyo drift So I saw the two prior posts about advice from boys(they both nailed it) , so I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring. This is more of a story than a list of advice, but there's still a valuable lesson to share. Anyways, on with the story.

Our tale begins in mid December last year; covid was unheard of, and people were looking to the new year with excitement and optimism.  I was working as a stage crew member of my school's Production. One day, during one of our breaks, I was sitting alone, flicking through my phone mindlessly. A girl, sitting with her friends, called me over. She started asking questions: what my hobbies were, what subjects I did, etc. After a while, I left to do some tasks for a teacher.

At the time, I was really confused as to why she did this- we had barely spoken before. But later that evening I realized: she saw me sitting by myself, assumed I was lonely and called me over. That small act of kindness stuck to me, and I'm certain i'm gonna remember it for the rest of my life. Any time I watch the news and lose hope in humanity, I remember the kindness that that girl showed me.

Moral of the story(This applies to everyone, boys, girls and everyone inbetween): you have no idea how  much a tiny act of kindness can help someone.",non-depression
121724,"All this college admission scam stuff made me want to tell you my sad story!So where do I begin, ever since I was 14 I've been wanting to go to the best university in my state (university of washington) Ever since I went to the campus at the age of 14, I've studied for basically my whole life. At the age of 18, I was rejected. So i went to a 2 year college with the intent to transfer in because I just couldnt imagine myself at any other university. During my time at this 2 year university, i went thriugh massive spouts of depression and suicidal thoughts.

 The only thing that pushed me through it was studying in the library of my dream school pretending to be a student there telling myself that it will one day be worth it. After i sent in my application, i literally walked around the campus for a few days just to see what it would be like to be a student there and look at the beauty of the campus. I even started to believe in god a year before applying and prayed all the time to make it into this school. I volunteered, worked many different jobs and worked my ass off the become the president of 3 clubs to try and polish my application. I spent a year writing the personal statement getting everything perfect and was in near tears when i submitted it.

 Im 20 now and got rejected once again will be attending the branch campus (tacoma) while my brother got accepted to the seattle campus straight out of high school. 

Now everytime I see the word college I just remind myself how much the universe hates me and doesnt want me to be happy. Sure, to you guys it may just be a school. But to me, getting into that college wouldve been a pay back for my dad for immigrating here and sacrificing his life and proof to him that Im not a complete failure. I literally told myself/god that the hope of getting in was the only thing stopping from killing myself. 

Getting in wouldve been a validation from the world that all the loneliness,depression, sadness I put in through high school and community college was worth it. Now I get to watch my brother go and enjoy the beauty of the campus that ive dreamed about for years. Now everytime I see the (tacoma) instead of (seattle) on my resume I'll always be reminded of the 4 years of sweat blood and tears i put into my dreams only to end up in an inevitable failure.",depression
235202,"Suicidal for most my life (from 12-30 years old)I’ve been suicidal almost 20 years now, for my entire adolescence and adult life. I’ve tried:

1) individual therapy
2) medication 
3) rehabilitation
4) partial hospitalization 
5) intensive outpatient program 
6) 2 stays in a public psych ward due to suicidality
7) group therapy 

(All for severe depression, trauma, anxiety)

I’ve read educational books, forced myself to exercise, and eat healthy. I’ve done CBT training and mindful meditation.

I feel like I’ve done almost all I can. My doctor wants me to try TMS but because of a recent brain injury I may only qualify for “superficial” TMS IF the TMS specialists think it’s safe for me to do, I met a specialist who only offered non-superficial TMS and he told me I could possibly be at higher risk for seizures. He also discussed ECT with me, and ketamine-therapy (unaffordable).

I’m tired of trying, honestly. I’ve done my very best for my family and friends. But at some point it’s unsustainable to live as a shell for others, suffering as an empty ghost for god knows how many more years. I’m like a puppet dancing for other people, but wooden and dead inside. 

I would like to have some dignity and choose something in my life. I did not choose trauma, abuse, or a lifelong mental illness.

I would like to choose death finally. People have told me “if you were really going to commit suicide, you would just do it already.”

I’m ready. My 20’s are over, it’s time to make a final decision. Fighting suicide does nothing. Once I accept my death, I can prepare for it and have something real to look forward to at last.",depression

121919,"I keep trying to continue but I'm at the end of my ropeSo I've browsed this subreddit for the past few months and every time I think of posting something I get too anxious and decide not to, but the past few days it's just gotten so bad that I'm struggling to carry on by myself, so I created an account just to post here.

I've suffered from depression for about eight years now, and had suicidal thoughts for seven of those. I've attempted suicide several times but, evidently, nothing's ever come from it. I started cutting myself, drinking a lot, and I became a drug addict. Now I'm not saying it's all been bad; I fell in love and because I wanted to be with her I managed to stop all of these things, and we've been going out for almost three and a half years.

But now I'm struggling to even get up in the morning. My girlfriend and I live six hours apart, and we see each other for one week every three months. I've failed university three times, on top of my depression I have ADHD which only makes me feel worse, I have no friends, no-one to speak to as my mum doesn't ever help with serious topics - not to mention she has depression as well - and my girlfriend works ridiculous hours - to give some perspective, her shift as of the day I write this is her working all day Sunday to Tuesday. I used to have friends but they got jealous that I had a girlfriend and they didn't, so they abandoned me, and the friends that stuck with me despite that left when they found out I had ADHD.

The one thing that makes me feel happy nowadays is writing, the only good thing I've ever said about myself is that I'm really creative, but in this day and age it's next to impossible to get found out. It's just gotten to a point where I've decided that my dream of being an author is idiotic and unrealistic.

I have no skills, no qualifications, and because I've failed uni three times it means it looks like to employers that I've done nothing since 2012. Even though the reason for me failing were not actually my fault; my grandmother died and I had to look after my mum, the next time it was because I was refused help for my ADHD, and the third time was for the same reason. But employers don't care for that, so the chances of me getting a job are stupidly low, and that's the one thing that my family ever say to me - I'd get onto the topic of my family but I feel like I'd be here for days.

I'm just hoping that someone who has felt like this before and carried on will say how they did it. I've kept myself going till now, I've helped other people stop having suicidal thoughts, but there's only so much lying to myself I can take before I decide that enough is enough. Am I being stupid and selfish for thinking like this? Should I be glad I at least have a girlfriend as other people don't? I just constantly think I shouldn't mention it as other people will always have it worse, that's why I've not received help for it. But if anyone has any suggestions, big or small, to give me, I would appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.",depression

It sounds so stupid but it's true; I've been thinking about killing myself every day, multiple times per day for the past few weeks. The reason? A breakup. My situation is pretty unique though (i think) so my feelings may or may not be justified. I mean, it's not like i know any of you, so i wouldn't lie to get sympathy. I've genuinely had debilitating depression symptoms for the past few weeks and part of me wants to end it just to stop feeling so much pain. 

She was perfect. Beautiful, smart, hard working, loving. With every little physical feature I'm attracted to rolled into one perfect package. She was so far beyond anything i could have ever dreamed of having. 

But fate is unkind. I'm a fucking loser. Always have been, but now i realize it more and more. I'm intelligent, hard-working when i need to be, incredibly loving, with huge friend groups plus more isolated friends on the outskirts, many of which are GREAT friends in every sense. I'm in shape, i have a six pack with big arms, I've been told my face is very attractive, I'm such a great guy, I'm so nice, my style is good, everything. But I'm a complete loser and there's nothing i can do to change that fact. 

We never fought. We were perfect for each other. We were best friends in every sense. We wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We had never had a fight in all of our relationship. She ended the relationship while telling me that she would compare her future boyfriends to me because i was so PERFECT. She told me she always wants me as a friend because I'm her absolute best friend and an amazing person. It had been 1.5 years. 

She wanted someone better than perfect. 

Why am i loser if my ex STILL tells me I'm the perfect guy, all of my friends love me, i get along with everybody i meet? 

The best girl i could ever meet left me because I'm 5'3 and balding early (i wear a hat that makes me look good, so height is the ONLY factor here). That's my only flaw. Fucking literally. I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I'm fucking out of options here. I can't do it anymore. I spent the first 18 years of my life wondering why i was cursed with this shit, why I'm a great man trapped in a boy's body. Why, no matter how much i want to (and do) improve myself i will NEVER be as good as the other guy who's even 5'8"". They can deal with ""short"" guys. Not guys THAT short though. 

What does it say that even the girl i poured every ounce of my being into, the one who WAS so in love with me based on personality, body, and ambition alone, got to the point where she just couldn't deal with me being this short anymore? How is this not going to just happen all over again in my future relationships? It's completely hopeless. She still loves me but can't fathom being with me. And I'm not mad at her. I wouldn't date an unattractive girl. I blame the world. I was given one phenotype that COMPLETELY ruined my life. 

My car just broke, I'm in huge amounts of loan debt, i can't do my homework because i can't stop hating my fucking life. I was doing okay a few weeks ago but it keeps getting worse. 

I wish there was a way that i could end my life without hurting the people who care about me. The only thing holding me back is what pain she would go through thinking she caused this and how my friends would feel about losing me. 

I just want someone to hold. She used to tell me everything would be okay, that WE would get through it all together. ""You and me, babe,"" she would say. I used to have pet names for her. I'd call her Bear or Bug, most commonly. She loved it. Now when i talk to her it's all of a sudden inappropriate to say that because she (like most women) is holding a sign that says ""you must be this tall to be the love of my life."" I just want to hold her one last time and never let go. 

I can't go on like this. I'm going to give it time to get better, but I'm completely miserable. I'm literally not worthy of love even from the ones who love me most. 

I hope it gets better. I never thought i would actually go through with it, but the feeling gets more intrusive every day.",depression

260848,"How far can Guilt get you?Over a decade ago I tried to commit suicide by driving off a bridge and failed in an incredibly improbable fashion.  A lot of people who do that seem to have epiphanies about how they really want to live after all, but I never did.

My epiphany was seeing the full extent of harm it would cause my parents.  They looked like they aged 10 years overnight.  I knew they loved me, and my death would hurt them, but now I can't un-learn the extent of it.  I want to die but I haven't been able to bring myself to hurt them that way.

So I graduated high school.  I graduated College. I got my office job. I got my big promotion.  I occasionally up the dose on my meds because they're the only thing keeping me alive, but it's getting harder and harder to force myself to make it work.

My parents are really healthy - big into nutrition and exercise and staying active.  They're getting older but could live another 20-40 years easily.  I've always told myself I could just wait until after they pass away, but I don't think I can make it that long anymore.

I don't know what I want out of posting this.  I've talked circles around this with therapists and psychiatrists, and there's no ""solution.""  I guess my hope is that someone here has had a suicidal loved one find a way to commit suicide without hurting those they leave behind.",depression

179532,"Well I fucked up for realI'm usually the one trying to talk people down but i need some help. Where do I start.....

This year has been a terribly trying year for me. My girlfriend of 15 years left my son and I. She left so abruptly and without warning that I still have most of her stuff. She left and immediately moved in with some other man. She wasnt faithful at all as I found out. We constantly fought about her drug use, cocaine was her poison, and when covid hit I took a stand. 

I asked her to stop going out and getting shit but she decided something else and left. Claiming I was always negative and wasnt there emotionally for her. I said these very things to her in the past. I was told for many years I'm worthless, useless, ugly and that no one would want me. I felt that way before her anyways but she always reminded me. Nevertheless, I loved her deeply.

She stole a car that I had put my name on for her. She doesn't have a license and neither does her new man so I took it back. Now she seriously doesnt talk to me, claiming I took her car. I didnt want junkies driving my son around. I didnt want them to endanger him anymore then when he goes over there. 

He spent the weekend at his moms new house and he barely ate. He slept on the floor because he has no room of his own. I just dont understand, I had tried to give them everything and asked for little in return. I'm scared for the future. I have a custody case going on now which I'll probably lose now and you'll see why if you keep reading.

I see the pain in my sons eyes and I havent been able to grieve for my lose either. I hurt deeply and cant bear the pain, which leads me to my most recent issue. I was arrested on felony charges over the weekend. My car was impounded and I spent the weekend of my birthday in jail. I'm lucky to be out today. 

To make it worse my father was involved in my issues over the weekend. He had taken a beating from police for something I dont even understand. I made a huge mistake and brought so much shame to my life and my family's. We both spent the holiday weekend in jail.

I cant kill myself because I dont want my kids to think dad is weak. So I checked into a mental hospital but I was too late as I already messed up in a royal way. They want to be supportive but how do I even begin to move forward? I'm going to lose everything I built up for years because of one terrible act. My job will be lost, my kids will be lost, my home and everything. 

I probably should end it, but how? I'm in such a panic and feel so much dread and terror. I cant leave my kids to my ex, who knows what she would do.  I dont have money for a lawyer as when I called they quoted me like 10k to represent me. I live with family due to my exs habits. I dont have much hope and really dont see why I should stick around.

My entire life has been focused around work, work, work. In middle school, I was told that it gets better in high school. Here is a list of things that happened to me during high school:

\- I was raped by 2 different people

\- A police officer shot me in the leg for ""looking suspicious""

\- My teachers actively avoided speaking to me

\- One teacher went as far as to say ""You are honestly a waste of oxygen"" in front of our class. Everyone laughed.

\- Every one of my peers ignored me, leaving me alone at all times. I had no friends.

Then I was told things would get better in college. Here is what has happened to me (so far) during college:

\- I was raped AGAIN

\- I was told I didn't belong in a club that was open to all students

\- My professors still ignore me

\- One professor called me an idiot for not understanding concepts for their class

\- The theater community here (I am a theater minor, and yes, I know it's a useless degree) has told me that I am ""ruining their overall appearance as a community""

\- Today, a TA called me an ""annoyance"" for asking him questions during his office hours

&amp;#x200B;

THEN people would tell me ""at least you have a good home."" Here is what has happened in my home:

\- My mom admitted to me that the only reason she had me was because she wanted a girl, then she said that I was a ""disappointment from the start""

\- My parents told me that I wasn't bi, I just ""hadn't experienced a woman yet""

\- The one pet I was allowed to own was a guinea pig, it contracted something that made its back legs stop working within the first 2 weeks. My parents killed it and never took it to the vet

I’m not going to go into too much depth because I don’t want to reveal who these people are and their personal issues, but around two years ago, I reconnected with a guy I knew and had a crush on in 5th grade. He became one of my closest friends quickly; he’s honestly an awesome guy. Shy, rough around the edges but super sweet. Nothing is cuter than when a guy quietly asks you in gym class to help him write a book with him and his friends, right? Anyway, things were going good and we were so, so close to dating, when he told me he was moving to another state. Great. We have kept in contact but I still like him...a lot. Like, a really lot. I don’t know how to get over it. I want to at least stay friends but I feel like I’m the one putting in the effort. He told me before that he appreciates it and doesn’t want me to stop trying but he still doesn’t reciprocate. It’s not like I’m being weird or anything, just trying to chat.

My best friend also moved away last year due to personal reasons. Really great. Since she lives almost an hour away now, we are barely able to see each other since neither of us have cars (and she doesn’t have her license). She never texts me anymore, and while I try, it’s exhausting. It seems like one ever gives me the same effort even thought it felt so easy when they were still around. If I stop trying to talk to my crush and best friend, I will literally have no one. Maybe you guys will understand what I mean, but I’m super awkward and shy, I have never been able to make friends, and it’s worse with this weird virtual/in school hybrid thing we’re doing right now.

253377,"Need help getting out of depressive episodeLast saturday, I tried to kill myself. I had a suicide note ready, hung a belt from the sprinkler pipe in my dorm room, stepped on the chair, hung it around my neck, and was about to kick the chair away. Except, I didn't do it; something about jumping off made me realize how utterly fucking stupid it was. I stopped, got of the chair, cried and tried to cut myself with a rusty old blunt envelope opener instead. 

Even though I am from the east coast, I am going to college in the midwest. Let's say that state is Oklahoma, and I go to the University of Oklahoma. My roommate is from Oklahoma, has no friends at the University of Oklahoma; they are all at Oklahoma State instead. He goes there often to hang out with his friends, so usually I'm left along on the weekends, which was why I had enough alone time to try hanging myself. According to him he got drunk at a frat party and danced/grinded/made out with some girl, which I thought was absolutely ironic. As he was having a good time, I was preparing to kill myself.


Anyway, that's besides the point. After I got off the chair, I just tried to cut myself; which was a failure. The skin didn't break. I was, instead, bleeding from beneath the skin, which I thought was pure poetic irony since it seemed like most of my problems were from the inside instead of on the surface. I had been suicidal for the past week, even reading the darn post on that metanoia.org website about suicide. I read it and thought to myself, ""this doesn't apply to me at all"". I was mostly referring to the point about how ""you're not weak if you are thinking of killing yourself blahblahblah"". The converse is true- I want to kill myself because I feel weak/worthless/flawed/whatever.


I guess now I should explain why I feel the way I feel. It's mostly a combination of pressure/work/highexpectations/feelingsofworthlessness which I've internalized, wound up inside my so tightly that it's beginning to fall apart. My parents blame me for being a failure for going to the University of Oklahoma (remember I'm making the name up) because it was ""not a good enough school""- I was supposed to go somewhere Ivy League instead. And that I am doing- they are making me transfer to an Ivy League school next year. They refused to celebrate my graduation because I didn't get into the college they wanted. By being at said university I am being constantly reminded of my ""faliure"". I am not allowed to get anything below a 3.7 GPA. I currently have a 3.92, so that's not a problem. My friends back home care about me or something, but don't really acknowledge that I'm there unless they need me for something or else they have no one else to talk to. Then, I become their therapist when I help them with their issues or hang out with them so they don't feel lonely. Except when they're done, they just sort of nudge me away. Not really anybody actually understands me, or cares to want to understand me. I fee like I'm living a lie. The worst part of all of this is that it's internalized.


I've had depressive episodes since high school (big stress environment, well known on the east coast). They were pretty severe, but at least I knew that they would go away because they were event triggered. Starting in college, these episodes got worse in the sense that they were no longer triggered by events but rather just came randomly. And they have been progressively getting worse, getting more frequent, longer, and severe. This depressive episode has been going on for a week and a half now, and the one before that was just a few days before the recent one started. I'm still in said depressive episode. I need to get out of it. It's just so much pain. I get migraines and feel dead inside, like somebody is unconsciously controlling my body and my conscious self is staring off into empty space. I can't focus, it's hard for me to read. This is really bad BECAUSE I HAVE A FUCKING EXAM TOMORROW AND I CAN'T STUDY FOR IT AND I CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE FUCKING FEELINGS OF KILLING MYSELF KEEP ON PREOCCUPYING ME AND I STILL HAVE THIS DAMN FUCKING HEADACHE. I really can't fail this exam, except I have learned nothing. I need help to get out of this so I can continue on with my life. I've tried playing uplifting music (The Go! Team), working out, taking a walk in the park, and while those things used to help with my depressive episodes, they just don't work anymore (I keep falling back to Joy Division). 


Nothing works anymore; I'm just stuck in this situation of feeling dead inside, that my life is worthless, that I have nothing to live for, that I have no place in life blahblahblah. Did I mention I'm just turned 18, even though I'm in college? I don't want to hear that crap about how OH YOU'RE SO YOUNG YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR because I've tried that shit before and it doesn't help. I've also heard the THINK OF HOW YOU HAVE IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE, and that also doesn't work. I'm getting unwound from all the strict parenting I've had for years (no texting! no toys when you were little! no friends until you're done studying! As on everything or else you get beatings, even till you're 18! No Xbox or videogames! Study Study Study! Math/French/SAT/Chemistry/Physics tutoring! Piano and Violin! No out of the house past 6, even though you're 18! {My Mom: OMGOMGOMG TWICETHROWNAWAY WHERE ARE YOU ARE YOU BEING RAPED OR EVEN WORSE ARE YOU SECRETLY DATING A WHITE GIRL?!?!?} DAMN ASIAN PARENTS HOW CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR BEING A FAILURE WHEN YOU MOLDED ME INTO BEING A GENERIC ASIAN KID WHO DOESN'T HAVE A PASSION FOR ANYTHING AND HAS HIGH SAT SCORES AND CAN PLAY THE FUCKING PIANO AND VIOLIN- WHAT KIND OF COLLEGE WANTS THAT KIND OF PERSON? I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU THIS SUMS UP MY FEELINGS OF YOU: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSjzdTBOWFc), and even though that's supposedly a cathartic experience of self-discovery and existential realization it's been nothing but misery and stress and losing 3 pounds in a week and attempts to kill myself.  Please help me? Please?


BTW the only reason why I mentioned my roommate is because he has everything that I have not- damn scholarship (because he's in state; my parents in addition to saying I'm a faliure grumble about how they have to finance said failure by paying exorbitant Out-Of-State costs), 4th in his school even though he didn't work very heard for it (Even he admits it- He has a 3.0 here, compared to my 3.6 in high school and 3.92 here), on the football/baseball teams, still has time to play friggin  Xbox 3 hours every day, texting, watching football and basketball and knowing the teams and how the actual game works (My father: Why the hell do you need to watch stupid mindless crap like that when you should be studying? Also never played a basketball game with me. Never really played with me; he was also preoccupied with making money and saving it in his fucking 401k) and most importantly, understanding parents who are lenient when it comes to academics (They think, ""Oh! He got into the University of Oklahoma! Prestigious school! It makes sense if he gets a bad grade or two since he's competing with so many other smart kids: and did I mention that I'm making up the school name?) and the DAMN FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHO HE WANTS TO BE.

26617,"(I don’t want this embarassing post to become a popular thing, so leave the orange/red be) So I have this bit of a dilemma here:

Last year on Valentine’s Day, I asked my crush out after knowing her for several years, probably much longer than I should’ve (although it was cripplingly obvious I liked her in eighth grade). 

She said that she didn’t see me that way, which was ok. The day after we had a text conversation and I told her I’d be fine soon enough.

Emotionally? I’m doing great and have been ever since then! Getting over her as a crush? Not quite...

Don’t get the wrong idea — it’s great having her as a friend, we tend to text now every 1-2 days and I’ve since been hanging out with her online (anime club, watching her favorite anime with her, minecraft, etc)

But, even so, every time I see her or read a text from her or hear her laugh or sing it feels like I just got hit by Cupid’s arrow. Again and again.

Every time I hear her get on an excited rant about a show she loves or every time I see her laugh from a meme I make, I’m completely and entirely incapable of not smiling. It takes several minutes after her leaving that the magic wears off and I’m back to my normal self (still happy, but in a more realistic/internally relaxed way)

I find that I pray very often that, so long as it doesn’t intrude on her free will, that God pulls some strings to bring us together. 

On one hand, I really want to try my luck again or maybe flirt a little to see how she responds. I know she’s not with anyone because we scheduled to watch her favorite show on the 14th online (and she explicitly said she didn’t have any plans), so it’s tempting.

But that’s the thing: I can’t help but think that if I ask her out again and she’s not into me, she’d think I’ll stay that way after last year. What if that changes the friendship and things become uncomfortable between us? What if that causes her and I to gradually drift apart? 

She’s so sweet and kind and cute, I’d still be happy with her as a friend even if it’s not exactly the relationship I sometimes dream of.

Money means little to me, but that's one of the reasons I'm terminating this experiment. I am almost broke, despite having made over $500,000 in the two and a half years since college graduation.

256983,"Another post written at 3 am about wanting to die.My father was a man that realized he had a fear of heights mid way jumping into fatherhood. He realized that a life void of drugs, was too much for him to bear. When addiction clawed it’s way from inside of him, nobody was left to clean up the pieces. I was only a baby when addiction, leaked it’s broken faucet muddy tap water into my footie pajamas. Addiction was the bedrock that set the foundation of my parents marriage. Addiction was the third partner in parent’s bedroom. Regret and a whole lotta pain only peaked their head through the cracks on the bedrock when their wasn’t enough cement “I hate yous” eroded inside. Jail was my parent’s favorite anniversary spot when they got caught stealing to feed their addiction again. I learned to love through expensive gifts so that way I could always buy my happiness. I learned to judge how much a man loved me from how much money he was willing to spend. I learned to love from a woman who didn’t know the difference between bitterness and affliction, couldn’t find the anger she tried so desperately to escape. I spent half of my life searching for myself in the bottom of boys with pretty smiles, and hard hands. Ive spent all of my life questioning why it was easier for my parents to love drugs than me. Questioning why it’s easier for me to love boys who don’t love me back. Because of this fact I didn’t question when I was raped. I like to pretend that loving myself is easy, but it’s soo damn hard. Especially when I’ve been conditioned to believe that I am worth nothing more than the punchline. Nothing more than a woman or a black bitch but if I’m really lucky I get to a female. That is until I’m to loud to be feminine, too obnoxious to stand in my womanhood, too eww to be considered anything more than not enough. When I was 14 I walked in on my grandmother snorting cocaine, perhaps this is the reason why I couldn’t bring myself to say grandmother until my great grandmother took her last breath. After I was raped, I didn’t feel like caring anymore. So I purposely endangered my life. Sometimes I wish I was murdered, instead of raped. It’d be easier that way, life after death should be easier that way.  I’ve spent my whole life on a calligraphy crash course called self destruction, and I can’t stop now. I’m ready to die, but the strength I need continues to allude me, confuse me. ",depression

187978,"The Dying Game.It was like seeing clouds with that resilient glow. Clouds that you knew would soon yield a heavy, warm moon. It was like watching the Sea of Tranquility gain its independence from a wall of night. 

She laid on that couch, with the blanket I had put over her, breathing those heavy breaths. She always did that. Even at perfect, resting slumber. She breathed hard. It was beautiful. It was something I used to lie awake listening to, as she turned the pages of some hazy dream, with me at her side. She slept soundly as the party wound down, everyone leaving. Jeff and Mayce were  going upstairs to bed. They offered me a blanket and pillow, which I turned down. I just wanted to sit there.

Its not that I wanted to die, sitting on that couch. It just would’ve been nice. 

We were fierce lovers. On and off for 11 years. Its hard to let something  like that go. Seven months ago she decided to end it, after a year of amazing nights, days, road trips. She said she let the situation  get more advanced than she was ready for. I told her I understood. That I was okay. I didn’t want to lie to her. But I also didn’t want to explain the ocean burning in my chest. It would’ve hurt her. It was better this way. Explanations are just cheap poetry. 

For the first time in seven months I saw her. I watched her laugh. I saw her eyes light up when each of her favorite songs came on. Heard her softly singing  along, hidden by conversations over joints, beer pong and the like. You wouldn’t know it, I’m sure, but we were the only two people on earth the whole night. For  me,  at least. There is no more  perfect sight than her.  

I sat there on that couch watching. Thinking. Wishing. So full of alcohol, which was necessary to endure the night. I sat there with my heart on fire. Hearing that voice in my head screaming. Throat bleeding. Until I started to cry. Something she’ll never know, that as she lay there in peace, I broke into pieces. 

My head was spinning. How much had we drank? Enough to allow for severe double vision. I was right though, its not that I wanted to die. I wanted to explode. I wanted to burst into flames and not experience anything ever again. I wanted the last time i ever saw her to be right there. The last time i saw anything. Standing right beside the most wonderful person I was ever loved by. So full of love and adoration. So full of pain and loneliness. Overflowing with opposites.

234153,"I go to bed knowing that I'll have to wake up tomorrow, and it scares the shit out of me.I'm contemplating suicide.
I have never been as alone as I am right now.  I have no one else to talk to.

The girl I love decided to date my bestfriend.  I've known each an equally long-amount of time.  About 7 years. She's going through a divorce, and I've been there since even before she got married.  Matter of factly, I was in that god damn wedding.  I helped her through all that shit, from her and her husbands first fights while still in a relationship to the death-throws of their marriage dissolving.  I've been as good a friend as anyone ever could.  Friendzone.  All that shit, blahblahblah.  I did not like her this far back.  I was involved in other people.  Wanting more than just her company came about a year ago.

I wasn't going to act on it during her divorce because that would have been grody, and I never would have imagined she would be able to cheat on her husband like she is doing now.  She's going through a divorce, sure, but still was hooking up with my best friend while he lived in the home.

My best friend knew too that I liked her.  Totally shit all over my cereal with that one.  That guy even kicked my teeth in while we were drunk, and I have my front teeth chipped still.  I can't handle the rage I feel over it.  It feels like vibrating and I just want to kill every nice thing in the world.

She was very curious as to why I decided to stop being friends with the guy she's dating.  I gave her my reasoning, and never did once lie to her.  I told her the truth, just not all of it.  I had assumed she'd of dropped me by now, because of how I was behaving toward my friend whom she is dating.  I figured she would have just left me alone in exchange for her relationship with him.  But she did not.  In fact she grew more affectionate, and I grew more and more confused.

I figured there was two paths from my actions of discontinuing being friends with whom she is currently dating and remained her friend; and they were that A) She would leave me alone, because I knew that I would never be able to do it on my own free will, and I wanted so much for her to leave me alone.  Or B) I would have to tell her the whole truth and that I really really like her.

And so it came down to B.  I had visited Florida the week before and sent her all sorts of pictures and spoke with her a lot while I was down there.  Several hours a day.  When I returned to my homeland, I knew things were going to happen.  Sure enough, she wanted the real answer.  She felt like she was to blame for my and my bestfriend's discontinuation, and I did not want her to feel that way.  So I told her that I was jealous.  I told her I was jealous because I like her.  I wasn't going to do anything or act on it or even bring it up until she had her shit squared with her divorce, but I had never got that chance because she hooked up with my best friend before any of that happened. That I was bitter.  I want to be mad at her.  I know a lot of it really is her fault, but never would have been if it weren't for my feelings.  

When I told her, we sat in the room in complete silence and she started to cry, and quietly reassured herself that she liked my friend.  Three hours.  Eventually we got to a concluding phrase and I took my exit.  We hug when we part ways for the night, but she hugged me and wouldn't let go of me.  We stood holding each other in her living room for as long as I could keep my breathing controlled.  I had to pry her off of me.  When we pulled away, she had her face turned very far away, presumably to keep me from kissing her, or to keep her from kissing me.  

It's been a week.  We still talk every day.  She said she didn't really know how to respond to me, and I told her that it wasn't anything that needed to be rushed.

I feel so alone that my love was not accepted by someone whom I tried my hardest to keep safe, to protect, to feel important, for so many years.  Love has never been too kind to me.  Each and every one of my long-term girlfriends were cheating, crazy bitches.  I feel not worthwhile, not worth my salt, when I try so hard to make people feel good.  To make things better.  To sacrifice myself for others.

I know that I won't be able to continue this, deep down.  I can't take care of her knowing I'm taking care of her for my friend's benefit.  It's selfish, and I have a hard time accepting that.  I want to invest my love in someone that will offer a return, but it's been so hard finding that.  It's been so hard that it feels like it's not them, and that it's me that's fucking up so badly.  Not just lady-friends either, but friends in general.  I get along with co-workers and colleges wonderfully well, but it's all shallow.

I just I don't know really what's up.  It isn't just this issue, either.  This is just a catalyst.  The shoestring that broke with no time left.  And I'm just so tired of trying.
I've been drinking an awful lot.  Usually drunk by noon.  I'll chew Vicodin and wash it down with whiskey only to smoke pot later and pass out and sleep for 15 hours when I don't have things like school work to do.

I'm actually a fairly nice looking guy, and I'm being humble.  I work out, wear nice fitting, matching clothes.  Am mildly intelligent, and I have, in my opinion, a great sense of humor.  I'm going to school for engineering.  I have great marks.  I play piano.  I'm unemployed right now but have worked at some impressive places and I have a very broad skillset.  I'm pleasant to be around when I am around folks.  Smiling, laughing, supportive.  

All I want to do in my life is share it.  Folks don't want what I have to share, and I take so much pride in what I share.  It feels that being a nice person is the wrong thing to do, and it's conflicting something awful.",depression

313281,"My mom called me a hoarder, but I’m not. I just don’t want to take care of myself anymore.I’ve been depressed since I was 7 years old. I’m 21 now. I’ve been suicidal for that same time as well. I’m still living at home because school is my first priority and my mom is “nice” enough to let me stay until I can graduate and get a stable job.

My room is not kept. It’s messy. I don’t have the energy to take care of it because I hate myself just as much. My cat’s litter box pushes out clean litter (it’s one of those self cleaning ones that pushes it to a different compartment). So I took my detachable vacuum to it to suck up the litter crystals that fell on the floor. My vacuum wasn’t working. It wasn’t sucking up the litter. So I texted my mom to see if she could get it working again. I was actively trying to clean my room. I have been trying for the last few days. But I have no drive. She doesn’t understand this.

She busted into my room and angrily took the vacuum from me. She looked at his litter and said “this is fucking disgusting. Does your boyfriend know you love like this?” He does. Becuase I tell him about my depression, lack of eating and drinking water, and lack of cleaning my room. He knows it’s a problem. But he’s never mad at me because of it. He has depression too. He understands. She keeps screaming at me about how disgusting I am and how I’m a hoarder. I’m not a hoarder. I just donated 2 overfilled bags of clothes to good will a couple days ago. I put new sheets on my bed. I washed all of my clothes. I have a big bag of trash that I was going to take down to the garbage can with the old litter I was replacing.

I started to cry because I hate being yelled at. I break down. I was in an abusive relationship last year and so whenever anyone yells at me, I don’t know what to do. She did “Stop that shit. Knock it the fuck off. You’re a hoarder and that’s disgusting.” I’m not a hoarder. I promise I’m not a hoarder. I just hate myself too much. When I have the drive to clean, I do. But she never notices.

When she left my room, in order to not hurt myself like I usually do when she yells at me, I called my boyfriend so I could calm down. I told him “I have to be quiet. She’ll hear me. My mom just yelled at me and I don’t feel like I’m in the right state of mind right now-“ and then I jumped when she opened my door. She said “Don’t be a fucking snitch. Don’t be a fucking tattletale. Clean up this shit right fucking now. Does he know you live like this?” The only thing I could think in my head is ‘yeah, he does. He knows it’s bad. But he knows I’ve been doing good these past few days in trying to clean it’.  But I knew that if I told my mom this, she’d get even more angry at me.

When she walked out again, I hurt myself pretty bad. I couldn’t deal with it. I was harm free for a few months. The last time I hurt myself was in early July. I was doing so well. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I’m currently locked in my room and the thoughts are really intrusive at the moment. It’s been an hour but I still can’t calm down. I’m panicking right now.

I have Tourette’s syndrome and she would yell at me when I would tic uncontrollably. I learned to suppress it so she wouldn’t be mad at me anymore. When I tell her about how I hurt myself or that I’m suicidal or have depression, she says “call a therapist and set up an appointment”. I don’t have health insurance now so even going to a therapist is out of the question... She never offers words of encouragement. She doesn’t tell me things are going to be okay. She doesn’t know how bad my depression has gotten or how long I’ve been depressed for. Being depressed for 14 years... she won’t believe it because I act happy around her. She gets mad when I tell her these things. The only reason I’m alive right now is that I’m too scared to die and I care about my boyfriend too much to leave him. It’s really bad. I’m not a hoarder. I just hate myself too much to live well. I’m trying to calm down as best as I can. My room is still locked so she won’t come in. I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t want to be a burden on my boyfriend. But now I’m overwhelmed with my room. I took down the trash, took care of the litter, but now I can’t vacuum because the suction isn’t working. She’s going to be so mad at me. I really want to leave, but I have no money. And she’ll get mad if I go to my boyfriend’s house to get away from this and calm down...",depression

I'm attending the Department of Veteran Affairs Hospital, and there I have been diagnosed with severe depression and Psychotic Disorder. I am severely depressed.

I just don't know at all.

It's the money. I'm only making 26k a year, but I have so much debt. I live at home with my older brother and mother, and if it weren't for them I would be homeless I think, or dead.

138526,"My storySo far, this is just random thoughts in order of occurance, for the most part.

It won't make sense to you, but over time, I will write about each incident to vent and slowly put my life story together. 

So far, I wish to remain anonymous, only because I fear hurting those who hurt me... An example being family members who I forgive for being pedophiles.

I never see it as a reality and have never admitted this in any serious manner, but someday, I would love to write a book.

I am passionate about sharing my life story because I feel like there are so many lessons to be learned.

So many secrets, breaking social norms, changing lifestyles, and so on... I have been told on several occasions from professionals and those I care about, that one of these incidences alone can break people, let alone several consecutive incidences with little to no support when needed most.

I am a half Vietnamese and half native Canadian. I don't really label myself, but I see myself as an intersectionist, liberal, and creative type. I am in a somewhat open marriage.

I am the oldest of four. Three girls then finally one boy. I am 30 and the youngest is 13.

My family has been heavily affected by intergenerational ripple effects of residential school and the Vietnam War. My grandma went to residential school and my dad was a Vietnam War refugee.

My family is in denial that they are affected by these, but I see the dysfunction and wish my family was raised with all the cultural life lessons that were stripped from both sides of my family.

Part of it though, was also because I wanted nothing to do with each culture of mine. I have internal conflict from time to time dealing with internal racism. This is because I grew up in a household with a pedophile on each side of my family simultaneously.

Before a traumatic incident in Vietnam (that happened to me),  I was already diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd. After Vietnam, I have also been diagnosed with panic disorder, personality disorder (with substance use/abuse/misuse), sleep problems, and sometimes psychosis. 

My family doesn't believe or understand mental illnesses.

These issues have been triggered because I married a man who is also half native, half Irish Canadian. He and his family, too, have had a strange amount of similar experiences, from residential school to poverty, addictions, suicides, sudden deaths, cancer, and so on.

...

Some projects I have on the go that not many people know... partially because I try not spending money by staying home a day for various reasons I will give in detail later; I have this juvenile mentality of ""don't ask don't tell;"" and if people interrupt me, which always happens, they don't deserve or care about my time and energy...

So some projects are

- Modeling

- Photography

- Wardrobe collaborating

- Realistic drawing of a model 

- Various social media sites such as FL, MM, FB, Insta, and of course, Reddit. (Debated Tumblr and have tried so many other sites)

- Hetting high-end camming gear lined up

- Still dealing with EI after applying for sickness benefits early March (and again, more details of my old corrupt employer and unprofessional family doctor will explain a lot about my current issues later on in my writings) 

- feeling the need to sell things online instead of giveaway (feeling broke, desperate, and things are out of my control)

- family will be in town

- hoping to see an old friend outside of the province

- seeing a counselor who seems out of it, but it's free.. 

- ""crime victim assistance program victim application"" form. So I worry about triggering myself looking at the Vietnam case. Again, more details to come. (Long story short, I was raped by hotel workers and the corrupt police asked me for a bribe, and I refused. Family abandoned me and so on when I needed them most)

- just realised this morning how a huge part of my sleep issue has been my fucking cat who wakes me up at 5 am this morning and daily, but today I slept 3 times. I was like in sleep paralysis, my sleep was so fucked and I was just so out of it an angry. Wish I realized or thought of this sooner. I mean, of course my hubby and I talked about it and he told me to wake him when she wakes me, but he sleeps like a fucking rock and that still means she shits on my sleep, but again, just wish I realized how much this has been affecting me and the simple solutions that are out there way sooner.

- I constantly debate what I want to do for a living, wanting to combine my interests and give up on my dreams of becoming a tattoo artist. Art cleans my soul but I feel like I don't deserve to do it unless I ""have all my chores done""

- my meds screws my libido and made me gain 50-70 pounds (again, that family doctor doesn't listen to my needs and I've been struggling to find a family doctor for months -again-), but yeah, this screws up the intimacy between my husband and I

Anyways, I'm gonna carry on with some of my other projects, but this shit is all constantly the murmurs in the back of my mind. The true mind of an artist? Lol all the rambling and late night whatevers.

Thanks so much for reading and any support. I would appreciate any advice &lt;3

By the way, I put this as suicide watch because in March, I admitted on social media to family, friends, and strangers of feeling suicidal, but here I am... still. Another day... another night...

13535,"I'm a broken toyI'm ill, I'm only getting worse, and that's a big problem... for my parents. Because I'm failing college, I've never had a job, and I'm on the verge of another dramatic meltdown like I experienced one year ago to the week or so. 

Panic disorder, social anxiety, agoraphobia... None of these things are just ""being shy."" And none of them are cured by subjecting yourself to more and more exposure. I've had \*no choice\*  but to expose myself for the +6 years that I've lived with these conditions. You \*cannot\* live in the 21st century without having to talk to people. I went through high school, graduated. I went to college, where I am now. I've pushed myself through every single presentation, group project; every class and, now, video conference expected of me. I've pushed myself to appear at the field trips, assemblies, celebrations, that weren't required, but where I knew I was tacitly expected to be. Every week, in and out. You would expect a change?

""Oh just do it, and it'll get easier."" ""You can't heal without putting yourself out there :)""

Last year, October, I had, at my college campus, panic that involved refusing to come home, an active manhunt by campus police to locate me as I ran through woodlands and eventually barricaded myself up on the fourth floor of a main building, where I proceeded to punch through doors, flip tables, scream like a banshee, and almost end up involuntarily committed to a psych ward. How did I avoid the last thing? Well, don't worry... it was only a few months before I actually ended up being held in hospital against my will :D

I know what's wrong with me. I try relentlessly to tell my parents, my extended family, my ""friends"", and even teachers and pure strangers what is going on in my mind. That their \*ideas\* about what will cure me ARE NOT what will cure me. That panics are unstoppable once they're underway, unless I have medicine, which I don't always have.

And they tell me... I'm lazy. That I'm looking for excuses not to be in school. That the money put into my education was wasted. That I'm not committed to my own health. That I'm untrustworthy. That I'm overreacting, that it's ""all in my head.""

What wasn't in my head was growing up abused by my father, walking on eggshells making sure not to trigger him in his irritable Bipolar moods. Growing up beaten for not adhering strictly to rules I had to divine from his head, because I should've known that's what he wanted. What isn't in my head is living with him for my entire life, wary of even looking at him the wrong way, lest I start an argument where things are thrown and I'm kicked out for the +5th time in the past two years. And growing up with a mother who does nothing but invalidate every feeling I have, that isn't blind compliance. Being followed behind and told to basically shut up any time I dare to panic - dare to have a biological event happen that I can't control without medicine, like I said. Being reminded of all the times and all the ways I've failed...

Not having good grades (because I couldn't ask teachers for help because anxiety and panics)

Not attending family get togethers anymore (because I have lost my ability to speak to them because anxiety and panics)

Never acknowledging ""the bright side"" of things, and ignoring ""my blessings"" (because I have reverted to having a toddler's social aptitude because of this fucking disorder).

No, no. I don't want to wait around ""for someone who loves me and cares about me."" I've come across enough people already, if none of them give a shit, what the hell's the point in waiting any longer. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to live anymore. I'm going to do everyone a favor and shut down, I'm the broken toy that disappoints everyone that plays with it.",depression

I have also learned 3 things I wished I applied way before in my life, and that is always telling the truth of those things you are certain to be true, always work hard with your individual situation, and act out of love, and not fear.
I have been afraid for a long time, anxious about everything and everyone. If I saw the slightest sign somebody wasn’t 100% okay with me, I’d get uncomfortable. In some ways I am a narcissist. I have big trouble seeing what others feel or listening to them fully. Although I usually understand what they meant and felt afterwards, when i’m alone and thinking of something else. And that is one more contradictive thing in my way of being that I don’t know how to accept. It’s like I’m broken as factory default. 
Because of not knowing exactly how others feel and not listening, as a kid I quickly learnt how to be liked and get things I wanted. Using face expressions, being funny, or being charming. Life blessed me with being attractive, and I used that too. 
I need to defend myself here and say also that I’m not cold, I don’t feel “emptiness”. Even though I have always been self absorbed I’ve felt too much aswell. It’s a contradiction. I love my parents, I love my family, I love those friends I made along the way. 
But I could switch too. I could hate my parents, my family and my friends. 
That extreme thinking has also disturbed me aswell, when I started understanding and being self aware of it. Sometimes I wish I hadn’t started caring about my life and actions, that I refused to go to therapy and open up. Maybe then I could have just continued the flow of life without ever looking back and just being part of the machine. 
But I have never been like this. I grew up basing my life around guilt, felt guilty about my parents separating. About my mom’s mental struggles, about me not being perfect. 
And why the guilt? 
Well, one of the reasons, is because I like men. I’m bisexual, (and a male). 
But then goes my christian beliefs as a kid. Another contradiction. So I put all that away. I don’t know what happened as a kid, but I know there is some trauma there. Because I don’t remember things, I have blocked periods of my life. Someone abused me physically and mentally, but I don’t know who it was. I don’t want to know either, and it doesn’t matter.
This would explain a lot of things. As my mental amnesia I’d have later on. My rage bursts.
I liked dudes. And I couldn’t share that, or live it. My maternal family is deeply religious and homophobic. And if they ever see this it’s alright I love you. Because you loved me. Hating them doesn’t solve anything. We become what we are exposed to. And they grew up being told gay people are not normal. And as I said before. My family did love me. They cared, they helped me many times over the years. All of you. 
My paternal family wasn’t near me all the time. They also loved me with all their heart. My parents separated and I stayed with my mom. My dad traveled back to his country. Which was far from where I was. He did all he could for me to not be affected by this.  And he flew over to see me, and put money every year so I could fly and see him. He had a telephone line to be able to speak with me.
Even though he was in another continent I felt his presence. And he has always been there. They both have, my mom and my dad loved and supported me inconditionally. And that’s all there needs to be. I’m so sorry for leaving you heartbroken now. I’m sorry all the love you gave me didn’t turn out the way you wanted to. I love you both and I never stopped doing that even though I became this lying, deceitful, lazy and addicted person. 
My addictions changed over the years but they were always about feeling safe, and seeking love.
I abused fastfood, alcohol, cigarrettes and medicine to feel protected.
I abused sex and all its forms to “cure” my emotional problems. Here is where it gets awful, degenerate, and the root of my serious mental struggles.
I repressed my homosexuality. As a teenager, I started having wet dreams about my classmates, and I even loved one of my friends back then. But I couldn’t.
How could I be gay? I need to make myself like only girls. So I blocked myself completely. This was 2009/10. The bullying became worse. I isolated myself from the world. And my parasitic behaviour began. I died inside because I didn’t want to live with my sexual orientation. So i stopped talking, I ate, watched tv and masturbated compulsively. And dealt with my “gayness” alone. I grew up without siblings. And my mom knew something was really wrong with me but didn’t know how to help.
I called my dad one day. Told him I was feeling awful and I wanted a new change in my life. So my parents talked about it and 2011 I flew over to my dad. I was so excited. Finally I would live with him. And get to know him beyond vacations. First weeks were great, we both were so happy about living together. I remember the first weekend we both took two bikes and just cycled around the whole neighbourhood. 
But then came a new dream. And I masturbated thinking of dudes again. Thinking back to this period I understood that I actually moved to my dad not only to live a new start, but also to be able to open up about this. Dad’s country is liberal, my mom’s not that much. This was a golden opportunity to finally open up. But I didn’t I continued to repress myself. Time went on and I went back to my same depressed, non social shell living with my dad. It was the first time I really felt suicidal. Seeing my dad desperate to help me, and me feeling like I couldn’t do anything, because fuck no I wouldn’t let myself be gay. I actually told him one day, that I thought I was gay. His immediate reaction was that he loved me no matter what. But the next day I forgot all about it. It was a lifelong habit of repressing myself. I just told him I was confused, and not being myself. 
This 6 month period before I returned to my mom shut down a light in me. I didnt take the chance to come out, and me and my dad couldn’t do the best out of something we had been wishing both since I existed.
When I got back to my mom, I promised myself I’d block everything gay related, and began a mantra. 
You like girls. You like girls. You like girls. they will come.  And as soon as gay thoughts appeared, I violently blocked them. 
Some months later back in school and by the end of that year I became in love. 
I met a girl in my parallel class. And we just fit right in.
She gave me so much and developed me, I was endlessly in love with her. We lost our virginity together and I knew I liked this, so I thought, could it be I was over my gayness? It gave me a peace, that wasn’t actually peace, but only foolishness. 
For two years, 2012 through 2014 I didn’t think of dudes sexually, or at least consciously. I remember having nightmares, cracked dreams where I’d see myself in gay situations. One of this dreams sparked a deep depression that ended with a suicide attempt at the beginning of 2014. That year I was back with my dad.He decided I should live with him, and blamed my mom for everything. Everyone did, her family too. And I never even tried to defend her. I let her take all the blame. My suicide affected everyone around me in so many ways. 2012 through 2014 was the best time of my life. I was in love, I had left my gay issues behind, I was liked, I felt powerful and surrounded by people that liked me. 
But the truth is always pinching around the corner.
So after a year in 2014, I had started school and lived with my dad l, trying to deal with what I did, being far from my my mom, my ex, my friends and the life I has built there. Felt like a complete failure. Somebody that hated himself so much he had to fuck it up with something to be back at feeling bad.
I started questioning many things, my isolation came back big time. 
At the end of that year I flew back to my Mom. And I was so anxious, my friends where graduating, my ex was with somebody else. Only thing I rly wanted was to see my mom. She was so happy to see me after a year. I remember her greeting me with a pizza, and with many plans for us to do. I’m so fucking sorry that I became resentful to you mom, you loved me like nobody else did, and my dad too. Always doing the best they could. 
But in this flight, I had to go through another country first. And waiting for the next plane from nowhere I just thought I had to check if I still liked dudes. Two years after I consciously made myself go through and face it. So like a weirdo I just went to the bathroom, and put on shirtless guys on google in my phone. I got aroused. I started panicking. It all came crashing down. I searched gay porn. I got aroused even more. I was lost, cracked again.
This is when another light shut down. This is when I lost touch with myself, and my relationship with sexuality. I arrived to mom’s country. And could keep appearances momentarily, until I shut down. I isolated even worse. I abused fast food, my mom didn’t know what to do. And worst of all, I lost control over porn. I started watching all day, all the time. 
All types of porn. Bisexual, gay, and all those other branches of fetishes you could find legally in pornsites. I started fantasizing about whatever I could. After a month my dad took a flight and picked me up, and we went back, more broken than ever. 
And I left my mom alone and even more broken.
I isolated myself further for 4,5 months.
Dissociated, ate and became fat. Masturbated and watched porn. All the time.
This is not excusable. I am not looking to be accepted. 
In some strange way I just want to be understood.
I know. I took the wrong choices. I should have been healthy about my sexuality when I was a teenager. And worked hard to love myself then.
This went on. I had small periods of lucidity, but fell into my craziness after some time. The ghost of my addiction and “shutting down” always came back at me. 
It developed further. I worked for a while, so I started with cam sex. I bought sex with prostitutes. Always girls.
I got myself in deep debt with cam sex.
Eventually I told my dad everything.
It broke him.
2017 was a year where I got myself out, and actually developed and learned to love myself for a while.
I moved to study in another city, my dad was a bit calmer and at least a little proud. My mom came to visit and she saw for the first time in years I was happy.
But the ghosts always return, and get you if you are fragile. 2018 was the year where I ended up wasting all my money again on escorts and getting myself in deep economic shit. The peak of it was spending a thousand dollars in just one night with a prostitute.
It was that bad. 
I lost it once again, only now I didn’t shut down.
I reacted outwards. And treated people horribly.
I got to the point where I thought I might become the unthinkable things you could imagine.
I am 23 years old.
And I haven’t crossed that line yet. But my past and my past actions tell me I will end there.
This is not love, this is fear. But I am telling my truth at least.
So I will break the cycle.",depression
95869,"Where can I talk about my thoughts that isn't this subredditI'm gonna be frank, I kinda hate this subreddit. Honestly that's mostly just because I kinda hate Reddit in general. But I have no one to talk to, so this place tends to be the only place I know where to go. Generally speaking my posts are ignored or people just comment something like ""relatable"" on them. When people do respond they usually offer to PM me and then ghost me. I can't really say I've ever actually had anyone make me feel better.

So does anyone know where else I can go? I'm so god-damned desperate. 

Don't say 7 cups, I fucking hate that place, even moreso than Reddit.

202368,"I don't know how to continueI was molested, beaten, had a gun put to my head when I was 5, watched my mom get beaten for 3 years during my childhood, and have struggled to continue to live.

I'm currently a senior in college.  I'm a little older than other students because I had a late start.  I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd recently.  The therapist said I would need counseling for many years.  I was taking several medications which helped some, but had some side effects including insomnia.  I never made it back to the doctor to follow up and get another prescription, and things have spiraled downhill since.  

I last took medicine and saw a therapist about a month ago.  Now I feel worse off than I was previously.  It's so hard to force myself to go get help.  I'm so ashamed of myself, my life, and how everything has turned out.  I never had thoughts of harming myself until tonight.  I couldn't bring myself to do it though because I love my family too much.  I haven't been to class since I stopped taking the medicine, just locked myself in my apartment.  I have the most supportive mother in the world, but I can never talk to her about my problems because she blames herself.  I don't feel comfortable talking to the therapist at school, and had to skip a lot of subjects that I didn't want to talk about.  I don't want to talk to other family or friends because they've always relied on me, not the other way around.

I recently tried to talk to one of my childhood abusers who I hadn't seen in 22 years.  I wanted an apology or some sign of remorse, and I didn't get it.  I wanted to be able to forgive her.  She's my father's ex-wife whom he married after him and my mom separated.  I hoped that aging from 28 years old to 50 years old would have allowed her to mature and have regrets, but it didn't.  She mocked me.  She said horrible, untrue things about myself, my family, my mom...and then she pretended that she didn't know who I was and said I ""must have the wrong person because she's never beaten or threatened to kill any child.""  I wish I had never tried to do that.  It was a huge mistake. 

I don't know if I can continue school at the moment.  I know there are options to withdraw and take some time off and come back to it, but I already had to do that once a couple years ago as a sophomore.  I don't want to disappoint my family.  The self-isolation has crippled me to the point that I don't feel comfortable leaving my apartment.  I know what I need to do, I know that I need to go back to the doctor, take medicine, continue therapy, and withdraw from school until I can sort myself out.  But I can't bring myself to do that.  I already feel like a failure, and I've already had a chance to get help and failed so quickly.  I don't even deserve another chance.",depression
294075,"My wild experience for the past few days... So, a while ago I was super depressed for a certain reason. I was so desperate that I asked reddit for help. Alot of people helped me and got me out of it, which inspired me. After a sometime I found a guy also asking for help on reddit. I helped him as much as I could. He was so happy after it. And I felt so good for helping someone. I've seen alot of posts from people in trouble, having serious problems and need help. So, I put up posts daily for 3 or 4 days offering help and listening to people in need. And I helped a lot of them, which also felt great. But a girl really needed help and I was too late to reply. I know I couldn't solve her problem by talking but she deleted her comment and it felt bad. I told my mother and she told me I should stop because I am not professional and hearing all of these bad things might depress me. She's got a point but I am willing to keep on helping people. overall it was a great experience and I hope it inspires someone.",non-depression

I’m in chronic pain. I’m always sick. My mom has Alzheimer’s and I know my dad will probably off himself when she dies. My older brother lives with them and cares for them but doesn’t work because of nerve problems. 

I was laid off recently and have limited work options. I live with my boyfriend (35f) in a home he owns. We split bills 50/50.

I’ve fallen behind on bills and I’m really at the end of my rope. Can’t stop thinking about how I should have just died when I was 4 years old and that it was a mistake for me to live. 

I told my boyfriend today as a last resort (I normally don’t “burden” people with my mental health struggles) because I was really desperate. And he made it all about him and  how he can’t keep supporting me and then left the room before completely leaving the house all together.

313913,"So yea, been thinking about attempting againI screwed up the best part of my years pretty bad... I had a lot going for me but somewhat along the way I just stopped caring. I drove my life deeper &amp; deeper into the ground. I have since, in the past couple years, started picking what little pieces I could back up &amp; have been trying to form what I guess I think a normal life should be. Needless to say I am failing. There is not a day that goes by I don't think about it &amp; I come close to attempting again almost as many times as I think about it. The last time I slit my left arm open because I didn't see any other way. I guess the shock of seeing an 8 inch gash &amp; visible bones scared me enough to not do the other. I'm just guessing though. I don't really remember much besides finding out my girlfriend of 7 years had been cheating on me for the last 2 with at least 6 different guys. I know, stupid reason, offing yourself because of a girl... But I loved her, &amp; really it was the total lack of empathy that she exhibited that truly crushed me. I wasn't a great boyfriend, I admit, but I treated her more than fairly. Didn't I? Why wouldn't she just leave me if she didn't want me? &amp; then, seeing her blank expression, the monotoned sigh, &amp; the shrug as she asked ""Yea, well, how'd you find out?"" 

I just lost it. That's her 1st thought? That?! Was our life together so unmeaningful? So I raged in my head as I looked at her with complete disbelief... I found out because she asked me to bring her phone from the kitchen &amp; it was open on a recent text. I thought just the one would be bad... She mentioned the other 6, again, with a sociopathic expression. It scared &amp; scarred me...

I have yet to recover. I was homeless at 1st, now I have an ok kitchen job staying with friends. But I hate my life.  I hate the lack of trust I have in myself &amp; people. I hate the humongous hole I dug myself into before I found that out. I hate that my family reaches out to help but then treat me like I'm not trying. I hate talking to people but I do because that's what you do, right? You socialize. You get to know people. I don't want to though... 

I know this has been an extreme rant, but it is a very abridged version of what my life is. I don't know how to recover. I'm 31 freaking years old &amp; I can't take care of myself. Pathetic, right?! I had her for most of my 20s &amp; before that I was in college. Now I am just scared of everything. I tell everyone who's aware that I will bounce back, not to worry. But how? It's not a matter of I don't know WHAT to do, it's that I lack the motivation to ACTUALLY DO IT. When I clock in at my job I am a star employee. As soon as I leave darkness just surrounds me &amp; suffocates me. I used to be one of those guys who could befriend anyone. Now I just look at everyone like a scared puppy who's been beaten everyday of his 3 weeks of life &amp; now all he sees are his abusers. 

I've never told anyone to the extent of how shitty I feel because I sound like a winey brat who's complaining because he didn't get his way. But I am freaking terrified &amp; everyday that itch to research a ""better"" way to kill myself intensifies. The thoughts are entering my mind more often. 

I guess that's the end of that rant. I have probably heard most of the advice of encouragement that anyone here would have to offer but it's always worth a shot right? (I just did a depressing laugh &amp; this is the 5th time I've thought about suicide since I woke up a couple hours ago with intense pain in the jaw I broke 10 years ago... Ask me about THAT story...)

Fuck life. If there is an afterlife, good. I will go to hell where I belong for all the shitty things I have done. &amp; if there isn't then there is just nothing. Personally, I hope God does exist... That there is good &amp; evil, not that we just evolved to be this way... Because if we did, none of us deserve to be here.

151849,"I don't want to live this lifeSince 9 I've always thought I'd be dead by 15, I have bad anxiety and my parents aren't very supportive and helpful when it comes to mental health. As I've gotten older I've been having more and more urges to kill myself and I know I should get help or see a school counselor but the only thing that's stopping me is that I'm scared my parents will find out how bad my mental health actually is. 

My father has a very old fashioned view on mental health and thinks I should just ""get over her insecurities"". I do wonder why he has these views on mental health when he married a woman who had some pretty bad trauma in her life and is diagnosed with MDD...

I easily get anxious in social situations, I am paranoid and I've never fully trusted someone. I'm 14 and I am still scared of the dark and I don't like people teasing me about my behavior or looks. I'm fixated on always being the best and even if I do get first place it usually doesn't feel like an achievement at all, it's just something that stops me from feeling bad. My emotions are dulled to the point where feeling something, other than sadness is a relief, I'm apathetic and my empathy is very impaired. I'm not confident and my self esteem is quite low to to the point where I dismiss my friend's compliments are lying to try to make me feel better. Getting praise from parents or anyone remotely close to me doesn't make me feel any better about myself but anything negative makes me disappointed and angry at myself. 

I used to be a very sensitive child and I think if I had been less sensitive I would have turned out a better person. I do think my parents weren't exactly *the best* at parenting.

I want some sort of relief from this and I've been thinking of killing myself this weekend, (please don't put ""don't kill yourself life will get better"" or a variation of that in comments, I hate it) and yes I know it's wrong but I don't see how I can change this without this whole situation making my relationship with my parents worse. So what can I do?",depression

48937,"I don't know how to copeLet me preface this by saying I have 2 kids. One is from my ex wife, my son, and I had him by myself from the time he was 3 months old until my wife and I met when he was 3. He is 15 now. Then my wife and I had a daughter. She is 9.

Ok, I am semi disabled. I am not considered disabled enough to get social security, but I am disabled enough that I can't work.

I am at home all the time. The only peace I get is when the wife is at work and the kids are in school. 

On the weekends, or after 3pm when then kids get home, it's nonstop CONSTANT bickering between them. 

Then add in the fact the wife gets home, and is stressed because I can't work and we barely scrape by, the SECOND she gets home, she starts pounding shots of vodka. 

Then it gets real interesting...

The kids continue their yelping at each other.... The wife is pounding shots of vodka, and my son and my wife CONSTANTLY fight. Nonstop. Each one expects me to pick their side, which I never do. I don't pick any sides. I normally just go to the other end of the house and put headphones on because the few times I have tried to stop them, it suddenly becomes my fault they are fighting (I know it isn't, but it's what the wife still says...) I can't take their fighting.... Over trivial petty shit. It can be anything from him putting ketchup on eggs to him simply wanting to use the dog soap to give his dog a bath. But it's constant. It's nonstop. Now my 9 year old sees this for what it is. This makes me feel even worse. Somehow it always comes down on me. It's always my fault somehow. Even though I don't fight. I don't drink. I don't do drugs (anymore.) But I still get told this is my fault... 

We recently moved back to my home where I grew up in Birmingham Alabama from Eugene Oregon. In Oregon to escape from the constant fighting, I found myself getting addicted to Heron. I won't say it was because of their fighting. I know I have to take responsibility for my own actions. But I sure used it as an escape. I got myself clean and recently celebrated 8 years of sobriety. 

Tonight though, I think I've had enough. It's so F-ing difficult staying alive just for the benefit of others. I know that I likely wouldn't survive another round of smack. But to be honest, drifting off and never waking up seems like my best recourse.

I just don't know what to do. 

My mind starts and it won't stop. I am having dreams of killing myself. In my dreams, the quietness of the darkness is just so satisfying. It makes me long for it.

I just don't see the point of fighting on. Because it's just another day. After I go to bed and have that peaceful dark quiet, it starts all over just a few short hours later.

You can call me weak or a coward... Although I have tried suicide before. I woke up 18 hours later with the rig still in my neck, spitting out teeth (I went face first into a porcelain sink.) And I can say without question that actually taking that step to end your life, is the least cowardly thing someone can do. It takes more courage to actually take that step than anything I've ever done before.

I just don't know how much longer I can hold out. Frankly, I don't see the point... ",depression

15747,"A melancholy feelingI've been suffering from a terrible depression for close to two years now. I think I can say that I am in a slightly better place than I was when I first attempted suicide. But things haven't really changed all that much. The issues I faced then still plague me today, and the overwhelming intrusive thoughts and feelings and emotions still do take over me from time to time. I've slit my wrists to cope with them twice. It was unpleasant but necessary and the pain from it was much more preferable than the pain that those overwhelming feelings have caused me. 
 
I've attempted to end my life twice now. First, four months ago in October, and earlier this year in January. I was warded for 32 nights at an Institution, where I was given a diagnosis of Mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. 
 
I've been attending psychotherapy sessions for a few months now and take my medication (fluoxetine, 20mg) regularly, which, I think, helps to give me a sense of stability and balance and the, hopefully, good sense to want to try to work things out. My psychologist is a terrific woman but I don't think she can really help me all that much. The sessions often make me more exhausted than relieved and it's really tiring. The medication I'm on currently helps to make me feel stable most days of the week, but it also makes me feel incredibly emotionally blunted and the stable effects are not consistent enough to provide me an adequate level of peace of mind. If things don't go well by August or the end of this year I think I may end up attempting suicide again. And this time it probably ain't gonna be by pill overdose. It's sickening to me to think that I wake up everyday with suicide always in the back of my mind, while everybody else wakes up ready to tackle the new day wish a fresh start and kiss their partners goodbye and go to their schools and jobs and better their career and education and live life to the fullest while I'm still stuck where I was two years ago. 

They say that for the vast majority of people suffering from depression, it indeed does get better. I guess I fall into the minority category then. Well, why not? I've been a minority and a misfit my whole life - it's just as well that I'm one even with this godforsaken illness.
 
Tell your friends you're physically ill; they send you get well soon wishes. If you're valuable enough, maybe they'll even send you gifts and come visit you.

And surely when it's your birthday, they'd at least wish you a happy birthday.
 
Surely. Surely. Surely...
 
Tell your friends you're mentally ill; they stop talking to you and dissociate themselves from you--finally making it crystal clear how little, if anything, you really meant to them. And the person you thought was your best friend tells you to ""stop fucking up your life like that.""
 
He could might as well have put a bullet in my head instead of saying the things he said to me. The effect would have been just the same.

No one sends you 'get well soon' cards or well-wishes when you're mentally ill. Not in my case, at least. There's no comfort or love or warmth in my life. Just the agonizing drudgery of my miserable, loveless, lonely life.

The two remaining friends I had left have ceased contact with me, finally making it crystal clear how little, if anything, I really meant to them.
 
I guess I should have known better. I wasn't even valuable enough to my two remaining friends to even be wished a happy birthday.
 
At this point in my life, I'm just a friendless worthless depressed lonely loser with nothing much going for him. I'm stuck in a ceaseless inertia that's taking ages to get out of, and every time I try to move one step forwards, I'm pushed two, three, a hundred steps back by my illness, my sister, components of my personality (ugly, undesirable, unattractive, unlovable, useless, worthless, repulsive, pathetic, miserable, loser.). I wake up everyday feeling like there's a noose around my neck that's getting tighter and tighter with the passing of each day; feeling like life itself is a disease for which the only cure is death, only to have the one friend I thought I had left in the world tell me to “stop fucking up your life like that,"" and that ""your pain is by far not the greatest."" It's been over four months since I first had contact with medical professionals. But nothing much has been improving. It's incredibly frustrating and exhausting but I'm determined not to give up--not yet, at least.

An online acquaintance, when learning of my predicament, said, ""10, 20 years from now, it would've been far worse if you were still ""friends"" with these people who don't really care about you,"" and, ""they have unwittingly given you a gift of freedom - seek out instead the real, true friends you truly deserve. They are out there.""
 
I do hope he's right, and that I'll be able to find those true friends, someday.

All I ever wanted was for someone to hold me and tell me that I'd be okay. And I'm not even deserving of that. 

Every single waking moment of my life is filled with agony and pain and anguish and gut-wrenching emptiness and misery. It hurts so much. I mean it actually really hurts - not just emotionally and mentally, but sometimes physically as well. I wish I was exaggerating.   

There are times when I'm able to find some modicum of hope that someday, things will be better. That tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow will be better, but I soon realize that a better tomorrow will perhaps never come, and that I’m forever going to be falling down this abyss of pain and loneliness and lovelessness and misery and suffering. I desperately want to get well and better, but every time I take one step forwards, this illness (and components of my personality) push me two, three, sixty, a hundred steps back. It's so fucking tiring, and there are days where I'm so completely washed over by a huge, nauseating wave of defeat that I can't even will myself to get out of bed and into the washroom to take a piss.

There's a story about villagers in the Solomon Islands who would get rid of an undesirable tree by gathering around it and yelling at it for thirty days straight. Eventually, the tree, from the negative energy of the yelling and screamings of the villagers, would topple over by itself. Except in my case it's not thirty days, but over two years now. And besides my sister's abuses I have this illness to deal with and my loneliness and anxieties and all the other thoughts spinning through my head like a bullet train on acid.

I'm hoping really hard that I don't snap one day and throw myself off a building. But so much time has been wasted, and is being wasted. The people I know from secondary school have moved on with their lives, made new friends, shared new experiences, found love, bettering their education, etc, and here I am, stuck, defeated, miserable, in pain, weary of life itself. And no one (other than my mum) cares. And with my enlistment coming up this year I think it's going to get even worse.

I don't wanna die but I also don't wanna live. I don't wanna live but I also don't wanna die. Does that make sense? I hope it does. 

I'm doing my best to just take it one day at a time, to just stay alive. It's pathetic, but I hope that's enough.

I wouldn't wish this illness on my worst enemy. I truly wouldn't.",depression
239242,"Things Didn't Get BetterI posted here back in 2015 or 2016. At the time I was living in old trailer in the woods without plumbing or electricity. My only help and transportation to get food or showers was an abusive family member. I'd pinned everything on getting my driver's license and being able to get a job and then improve my life. 


I of course failed the driver's exam and was banned from further attempts since my state doesn't allow more than 3 attempts.


Today nothing has changed much. I have a job I love but it doesn't pay much but I still can't drive and am helpless and dependent on an abusive relative. They verbally rip me apart and destroy my things. When I stil had to physically go into work they would threaten to withold rides from me, and now that I work from home because of the pandemic, they will make louds calls talking about slurs and rape and things when I'm supposed to be taking calls from customers.


Nothing has changed or gotten better. I'm still helpless and abused. I actually developed a brain mass that damaged my vision. I have carpal tunnel or arthritis and have lost all my hobbies (drawing, gaming) as a result. My abusive relative wastes the money I earn--I pay all our bills, they don't work. My brother, the person I loved most in the world, killed himself a year and a half ago. I feel like it's just an inevitability before the abuse drives me to do the same. 

I did manage to live on my own for a year and a half. And I never managed to make friends, except for one person who would not openly be my friend because ""my ex will think we're sleeping together"". What does it say about me that the only person who would willingly be around me will only do so in secret?

I just cant believe how helpless and easily controlled not being able to drive makes you, and there's basically no one way out if you don't have a supportive family or friends to loan you a car and help you practice. Society doesn't care at all that it's basically condemned people to die or live as helpless victims their entire lives.

Long story short, my mom sold a cake for this girl's 18th birthday (let's call this girl Martha) and while handing it over joked how she should have sent me, since I'm also 18. Later one, while I was with my girlfriend, Martha sends me a message on insta.

At first the message was pretty normal. She told me to congratulate my mom on the amazing cake, nothing weird. Then she started joking how it's a shame I wasn't there to hant it over. That's when I became suspicious. Then I saw that Martha's friend posted a story that said ""Martha is looking for a boyfriend hahahahaha""

At that point there was no doubt about it. My girlfriend wanted me to just tell her I'm taken, but that felt too direct and rude and also I was afraid I might be wrong and it's a coincidence. I ended up more or less just leaving her on seen.

Later one, I saw she sent me a video. I knew from her stories she was a drunk because she was celebrating her birthday.

88187,"Out of the Game. Well, I'm going to go along with the option of suicide. I utterly despise my life and this world. I'm a young person (17 year old male and high school senior), but enough is enough. I've barely started this game but I'm going to permanently log myself out of it for eternity. I've decided to leave a vast note behind for anyone that wants to understand why I did what I did. It might be extremely confusing and out of the ordinary for most people, but that is how my thought process goes. 

I'm getting strong medication from someone that attends the same local public high school as I do. I have my parent's alcohol to consume that will counteract the drug to make death more probable. Overdose is not the safest and easiest way to go, it's actually pretty idiotic, but it will have to do. Nothing can fix my situation. All other avenues are not approachable or helpful. ",depression

74618,"hurtingI need to vent... I've had attempts in my recent enough past and have felt so desperately close at times in the past couple of months to making another one. After the last one I got out and actually saw a psych and got on antidepressents. This was in large the help from my best friend. It's for her sake that I really keep trying though it's so very hard. At the same time, I've another friend who I've taken in as my roommate while she get's back on her feet.  

She has faced and has so much of the same trauma that I do as well. A couple of the highlights are Major Depression; Rape; Transgender. We formed a suicide pact as a way to try and keep going so long as either of us has the smallest amount of energy. That's if any action is taken it has to be done unanimously and together. It's helped for the past year or so now with us each having turns being really bad off.

Yesterday she wasn't well. We were texting each other while I was at work and I let her know I'd be calling in around 40 min to actually talk with her. We did keep texting and when the time came I called and I could barely understand her as it was garbled at times but either way I worked to support her. Later that evening when she had gone in to work, I joined her there so we could talk abit and so that I could better support her even more. Turns out the ungarbled story was that she kept spiraling and made an attempt. She was going for strangulation with bondage rope I have in my room. I had called as she felt she was starting to lose consciousness but had the presence of mind to adjust her weight to stop the process. If I had called five minutes later she'd be dead at home and I'd have joined her when I arrived. We renewed our promises of no drinking alone and no attempts alone.  

So of course now today I'm really not doing well myself. I get bad off and then have the urge to dig in deeper to my depression as it feels so familiar. I'm left thinking that maybe I'd be free by now if I hadn't called. That my mind works against me trying to convince me that my best friend would be better without me. She's the beneficiary in my will so it would help her financially with I know is nothing compared to how I try to help her emotionally. But it's like I told her recently, that I feel like I'm only hiding or swallowing my pain and sadness constantly in order to help her or the roommate. I've cried myself to sleep so often lately that it's now the norm.  

I guess I'm just tired and really want to be finished. I've an immeasurable amount of self hate that feels like it'll never be better. I'm never NOT going to be trans. I wish my bestie would just hate me or that I could run away from everything and just disappear. Things are getting really intense lately with the breakdowns and I guess this is me asking for help or just kind words from strangers. The roommate and I have taken 2 trips now that we had talked about very possibly turning into a final trip but the bestie joined us on both. That kept us from taking any actions but both times the besties feeling have been hurt unintentionally which results in a semisweet sort of trip. Overall probably alittle more positive but not as great as it could've been for all of us. The bestie is of course dealing with major depression herself so we're just one hell of a friend group...  

So yea... I'm tired and hurting. I'm doing what I can to try and keep going but the depression is still always right there beside me. We've been losing weight together as a group, doing these trips like camping and such, we've all been trying to go for better mental health with our own therapists and antidepressents. I've got half of the roommates and my planned method. The roommate ordered that half when she was previously crashed. Thing is I previously had ordered the entire thing myself back in September? I was destitute and just couldn't stop crying and hurting so badly that I ordered it all. Within the 3 day delivery window though the bestie helped put me back together enough that I let her know I had it so she could take it all and dispose of it. She did and that's when she had me get out to the psych... Just... things aren't well...",depression

Another year and another handful of attempts later, here I am. Against all rhyme and reason I stand. I've heard so much motivational drivel that at this point it just goes in and out of my ears like trying to catch water with a dishrag. For years, the same ""it'll get better!"" ""you are more than this"" ""it's just a feeling"" bullshit. Nearly four years since I was diagnosed with depression, three years on various meds, and over a decade of feeling like this. 

This year, I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking purpose. Am I young? Yes. Have I had hope that I'd one day amount to something? Yes. But nothing interests me or makes me feel whole. I've gone to therapy, worked out, tried every medication. I've cut off friends and family alike. It's easier to go if nobody cares, or thinks it's better off that I'm dead. I've hurt people. Really hurt them deep, in ways they'll probably never heal from. Everything that I bring to the table is manipulativeness, pain, and dishonesty. 

I don't want to see the new year, there's no hope left. No light at the end of the tunnel. Not for me anyways, whatever's to come will be better when I'm gone.

Unsure if this is a final goodbye or some twisted cry for help or just the rantings of some sick, sad person. I'll keep you posted.

((Good luck with the novel below, I'd be surprised if I finish it))

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled with mental health since I can remember. It was hard to discuss the idea of tics, ocd, or depression with parents who didn't understand vulnerability. They aren't the hugging and comforting type, I can probably count on my fingers the times they've told me they loved me.

My father is a borderline alcoholic and has always been a mean drunk. I will never forget the times he's taken out his frustrations on me and berated my younger self about my worthlessness and the burden I am to him.

On top of that has always valued my older brother and made it verbally and abundantly clear as I grew older. My mother sometimes defended me for this reason which caused a large divide in my parents marriage, one which I was constantly blamed for. 

They're still together and closer now than before, since my brother moved out and became very successful they have all the more reason to berate me and compare me and my worthlessness to him.

I didn't move out at 18 because I wasn't able to support myself financially and I believed I was worth higher education.

I'm 22 and now finishing up my university engineering degree, given that was the only valid option in my eyes and controlling parents. I've been financially dependant on my them because of this option and it's held over my head every day.

I got into financial mess trying to margin trade a year ago when I believed it was the key to relieve myself of the abusive household I lived in. It turned into a vicious gambling cycle where I lost, and would continue to sink, more and more to escape the debt I had been accumulating. It came to a point last year where I stole money from my father to pay my bills, something which he caught and forever made me regret. I stayed at my friends place but eventually was allowed back with grace of my mother, however I was treated like a prisoner and was not allowed in or out of the house without supervision..there are cameras, locks, and an alarm that they track. (The ironic thing is that after everything my life at home only got worse, and I was even farther from the financial means to escape)

I cleared most of my debt 8 months ago but as home got even worse, market opportunities looked better, and the burden of paying for more expensive schooling that I failed; I fell back into my old cycle again and my parents don't know. I'm now 8k in debt.

I struggled a lot with school but I competed 90% of my courses. (so close yet so far) and failed 3 classes last semester meaning I'll need to retake and pay for them them again next year.

I'm working full-time midnights at a local factory and taking 4 classes during the day to make up for being set back. I have almost no sanity left and am criticized by my family whenever i'm seen taking a break or sleeping because they believe I'm not trying hard enough.

I'm jaded from everything but have really recently reached a point of complete hopelessness. Do you know what its like to feel completely trapped and frustrated in a life where you know you deserve better but every attempt is only a bigger setback?

I reached out to my brother who now lives on the other side of the country. I discussed suicide and he told me of his story about failing to kill himself when he was young, something I did not know of. He was bullied and home was no better so I understand why he tried. He got help and made something of himself. (as someone who is almost at millionaire status I told I was on my own financially)

Other than that one conversation, he doesn't care. I've reached out often now that I have really been considering it but he doesn't answer; he told me i'm a failure. I made it clear I did not want him to mention anything to our parents because we both know it would only cause more issues. (They see it as a selfish, weak thing to do, and if they found out about my finances i'd be on the street and disowned completely)

&amp;#x200B;

In this world I feel that if there are people meant for success, than there are people meant for failure. It's a fact of life that not everyone will cut it - and against all my efforts to better my life I just can't succeed. I have close friends but they're not ones to understand the gravity of my situation, I've been having trouble finding someone who has.

I want to go out on my own terms, something I feel like probably won't happen given the way things have gone. I don't want to hurt anyone, maybe something funny, or memorable like SEATAC. I've debated donating sperm to continue on my genetic lineage and become an organ donor to save a couple lives... (But what does it matter when I'm eternally gone anyways?)

I'm not here for sentiments I'm here for a valid reason to live... to sway my bias, because suicide hotlines and friends and family aren't an option.",depression

Basically I've been screwed by my state and I'm losing my children. Monday is my boy's birthday and they're (coincidentally? or is it just another cruel joke?) having the hearing on his birthday whether or not to terminate my rights to them.

Now I'll admit I didn't do 100% of the things I could have to get them back but if I had to guess I'd say I put in 90% effort. Which isn't good enough because I should have done 110% but it's too late now. I know I fucked up here and there and depression got the best of me sometimes and I just didn't put in the work I should have. However, I also feel I've been conspired against and that the state agency worked damn hard to get my kids out from under me. What pisses me off about it is that the kids weren't taken from me, they were taken from my ex husband, I never failed a drug test, I never abused them, I never missed a visit. The only thing I lack was a fucking house and a proper family that would be able to help me in this dark time. So shit happened and now I'm about to not be a mother anymore. I freakin' lost everything. Because I know I failed them I don't really see a point in waiting until they become adults on the off chance they'll find me someday. Even if I did live I'd just be a shell of myself and I don't deserve to be a mother anyway because I apparently failed somewhere in the last few years. 

Their father told me he gave up already. My mother says the same thing. The rest of my family are too self involved to do anything for me. I have no money. No job. Sleeping in a shelter tomorrow night because my mother says it's too late for the kids and it's implied that I don't need to be here.

Thursday is my last visit with them. It's gonna be so hard. I'm looking forward to seeing them since they cut my visits down to an hour a month supervised back in September. But it still will be hard to not cry.

Crying. 

That's the thing I'm sick of the most. I cry all the time. I wake up no later than 6am every morning because I'm crying in my sleep. I cry without much warning throughout the day at the slightest thought of them. I cry myself to sleep. Goddamnit I'm tired of crying. I can't keep crying for the next 15 years... or until the baby finds me when she's an adult.

When I get my tax refund I'm buying that damn pistol and I'm going to go down to the river where they spread my Poppy's ashes and taking my life there by that one tree. I think about it all the time. I get suicidal every once in a while but this last month it's been getting closer and closer. Thinking about my last day is the only relief I get anymore. I would have told the therapist they make me go to but I was too afraid she'd tell someone how badly off I am and they'd lock me down and then the social workers would be all over that. Another big ass check mark on how unfit I am. So I never said anything because back then there was hope for the kids and I. Now it's a secret I can't afford to spill because I have to go. I have to. I just can't do it anymore. ",depression

177720,"I had to make a throwaway... I need someone to hear me out.I've always had to fight to get love. I grew up that way. With my mom... She always picked her new boyfriend or husband over me. And as much as I love her... I resent that she doesn't remember my childhood because she was too focused on every other guy in her life.
But then she met a man who was so abusive. So severely abusive. He threatened us, hurt us, he was a SICK fucking killer. (Literally...) He killed his brother. He was my stepdad. I spent a lot of my childhood scared to death of coming home, but being too much of a loser at school to take comfort in the trust of friendship. To get the emotional support I needed as a little kid. I started going to therapy...but it never helped. The therapist was sworn to secrecy. She could never help. Maybe she failed me by not reporting the abuse. But going home was frightening. I would run as fast as I could to my room and just stay there. I would pray he didn't see me. I rarely left unless I had to. I immersed myself in books as a result. Probably why I'm so obsessed with Harry Potter. It's the series I found myself reading again and again and again. My only escape from reality was those books. They became my life because mine was too frightening.
My stepdad cut a hole in my wall when I was a kid... He would watch me at night. Daytime, too. Once when I was young I decided to touch myself. I was a kid, and I was curious. Turns out it's not that all that rare for a kid to do this unconsciously. Well, I was doing this, and heard a noise so I looked up, and my stepdad quickly closed the hole in the wall. I don't know if I could ever see a guy the same way. I've never trusted men in relationships. I try to, but I can't. 

Maybe it was a defense mechanism against him, but I would repeat this sentence to myself in a psychotic state. I can't even remember the sentence anymore. But I DO remember that I had to say it a certain way, at a certain speed, with the exact words. And if I didn't do it perfect, I'd have to do it again. And if THAT was wrong, AGAIN. And again, and again, and again. Well, I had a lisp. So did I get the sentence perfect? No. Not once. Never did either. I would end up falling asleep SOBBING the words out to this sentence I couldn't say. I'm not sure if it was my fear of him or not... But looking back now, I have a feeling it was. I was later diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in high school. 

I think my stepdads abuse is the reason why the only man I've ever truly been in love with was an awful person. This boyfriend treated me like shit. Didn't give me the love I deserved. He abandoned me. Never put me first. Slept with other women and gave them his heart. But somehow I loved HIM more than any of the men that treated me well.
No other guy has ever earned my trust. Any good deed they do, I assume is to hurt me. I have this terrible paranoia. If I hear people laughing when I walk by, I think it's about me. If someone tells me I look nice, I run into a restroom to see whats wrong with me. If a guy tells me he likes me, I assume he's a sick pervert who just wants sex. Then I abuse myself by sleeping with men that don't deserve me and the things I have to give. 

I do thoroughly believe that I am a sick person. Mentally. I am wrong. I am fucked up. I am sick. I don't think I've ever deserved the chances I've been given and I REALLY believe that my endometriosis is a part of my karma cosmic punishment.

My childhood wasn't enough of punishment I guess. My stepdads brother tried to kill me in elementary school. One of the scariest moments of my life. I never saw him again. Years later (quite a few really) I found out my stepdad killed him. Not in revenge for me, but because he wanted something that their parents left to the brother.

But his brother wasn't the only problem. My stepdad used to choke me. Hurt me. He would beat my mom. He'd hit me, he'd hide drugs and alcohol in my room to make my mom believe I was the problem in the home and that I deserved nothing more than a cheap bed in the basement. This went on until I was 17 years old. 

There was 2 years that I moved in with my dad but that wasn't much better. My dad had an alcohol problem and couldn't deal with anything. When I was 15, I decided to kill myself. I didn't have friends. I hated my life. I assumed god had abandoned me like he had Jesus. So I decided to do it. Took a bottle of Excedrin. But I woke up the next morning. I was paralyzed. Was finally taken to the hospital and ended up with pneumonia. I had an inhaler for 6 months.

When I got home from the hospital, my dad told me ""Anyone who tries to kill themselves deserves to die"". This set me off. I slit my wrists. Deep. Hard. I was bleeding so much. I still have deep scars from them that day. I called my mom. I told her to pick me up. She said she would in a few days. She said she left my stepdad and that we could be happy together.

So a few days later I moved in with her. Things were good for a while. But then she said she loved him and that he was moving back in. Things were back to how they used to be. Hiding drugs in my room, not letting me come home at night. I was 16 and dating a boy named Ian at one point and had to stay at his house and explain to his parents that I wasn't allowed to come home because my stepdad would hurt me if I did.
This same year, my dad tried to commit suicide. Then my sister...A few months later, my mom made an attempt as well. 16 years old and everyone in my family tried to off themselves.

I will never be able to lead a happy or normal life.

I currently live in a studio with my sister and he girlfriend. (Which I never agreed to, her girlfriend just chose to move in one day and refuses to move out)

Today the girlfriend was trying to help her friend who wanted to commit suicide. My sister said that they should just do it. They had nothing to live for. I told her that she was a sick person for saying such an awful thing, given our history, and she laughed and said ""And the best part is? I don't give a fuck."" Needless to say, I've been sobbing now for a good while. No one is available to talk and all I can do is keep remembering things from my childhood and sob some more over it again and again. This is my life.

I'm hurting. I can't sleep at night. My sisters girlfriend turns on the lights while I try to sleep and I end up sleeping in my car some nights.

My boyfriend can't be there for me, he tells me to pray to god. As if that makes up for my childhood. God abandoned me as a kid, and I will not pray to him now.

My friends are all busy with their families and boyfriends. I ask for help on facebook and get called an attention whore. I give up. 

I want to kill myself. I think about it every night. Without fail. I can't imagine myself and picture a future for me. I think it's because I don't have one.

I need someone to talk to. I need help. I need someone to NOT tell me ""it will be okay.""

It doesn't matter if it's okay momentarily later, because I am hurting NOW!",depression

I’ve tried talking to new people and everyone usually uses what has happened against me, even some of the people that are super close to me.

Last year or old principle retired and she was awesome. She put me talk health as a high priority and made sure we were able to do our work with as little stress as possible but this year our new principle is nothing like that. 

We've been doing completely online school besides extra activities. Personality I did marching band and golf. Last year it was my freshman year and it was fine. Our school had a rule where you can only have 1 fail until you can't do and extra activities. This year our new principle changed it so you can't have a fail in any classes. This is a big change for most of the school. I had one F last year so I was able to do my stuff this year but she changed it about a week ago. I only have one more golf thing to do then the golf year is over and we finished marching band really early, but I want to do more outside of fall. The only reason I did school last year was for the extra stuff and if I can't do it this year I'm just going die.

In my 8th grade year I was a great student so they put my in all Pre AP and AP classes this year and last year. It is and was stupid stressful but last year my extras were the thing keeping my grounded, keeping me from giving up in school. This year I feel like there's no chance of me doing anything else. I have been trying my best in all my classes but when I look at my grades all I see is disappoinment. I don't know if any other school have this rule but it's just too much for me. They should give us some slack this year because it's so shitty, but they just raised moved the finishing line.

I've reached the point where i can't make up my own decisions anymore, my mom just decides on every fuckin aspect of my life. I'm sorry if my grades are in the mid 60%s, and i don't want to waste 100$ applying to university to get rejected, but is she simply unable to accept the fact that I'm not going to university in september. (as a note she's a poli sci teacher, and my sister's in a big poli sci/law program) and I'm not trying to live up to my sisters level, so i don't know if that makes it worse for me. My parents are divorced, from a year ago, and she just despises my dad, always bringing up how bad ""my father did"" in university, and how i shouldn't take after him. I'm turning 18 in august, and the legally age for me to be able to make up my own mind and live with who i want is 16, so legally, i'm allowed to leave and go live with my dad, BUT NO, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO. I've got two turtles and some fish that live there, and when i need to feed them while my dads helping my grandmother who lives far north (who i also found out has pancreatic cancer about two months ago, and is still on meds), my mom doesn't let me leave the house, or will drive me there, and I'm not allowed to drive myself either. so that leaves my biking for the hour and a half there and the hour and a half back. Which massively stops my weekends, and now I'm being forced by my mom to go to a private university because she can't stand the fact that I've not applied to any already. It's not that I'm against going to a private university, it's that she wants me to go to a christian university. I won't say i'm incredibly religious, but i'm not atheist, it's just that i'm not deeply invested into religious things.

My plan already is to go to a college, not first term, second term start most likely, or i just work for this year and make some money, so i actually have a basis to work with. But my mom still hates the fact that I'm not a prize student. I've got 3 sisters and no brothers, two of which are top of the line students and are taking after my mom in everything and one who's to young to care. And yea, I'm the only guy, my grandfather died before i was born, and my other grandpa died in 2014, when i was 11. My only older male cousin is about 10 years older than me, and the cousin that's a year younger than me lives across the country (Canada). So my role models have been very limited, i moved from a small town when i was 8, and after i moved i then grew up in, i wont say bad, but worse than what i had previously, conditions. I lost contact with most of my friends from my old town when i moved, this was before everyone had cell phones, and then struggled a lot to make new ones once i moved. I have brought up the request to move back to my old town, where i had friends, but got nowhere with it.

Yes before anyone asks i have contemplated suicide before, and i just didn't because i thought there was more stuff to do with myself. i was always thinking about this stuff through my first years of high school, it was just a reoccurring thought. i was getting beat up and bullied almost every day of class i couldn't bring myself to tell anyone about it, so i just dealt with it the best i could. in hindsight i should've told someone but now its gone to shit anyways. I've always been the ""quiet kid"" at school, never brought a gun to school though, I'm not american, but i have wished death on some classmates before. I've never figured out why I'm the odd one out of the class, might be because I'm one of the only white kids in the whole school. Teachers wont do shit about it anyways.

My dad's more appreciative, and is looking out for me however, making sure that I'm actually paying attention to the work i have and helping me get through all this, i don't want to go and only live with him, but the way my mom's acting i might.

The point is though that i can't open up about it all no matter how much i want to. This isn't helped by the fact that i get often threatened to be taken into the local hospital because i am having a way to low weight for my height and getting told the psychiatrist is obliged to have get me into the hospital if i show signs of suicidal tendencies. So yeah, i feel like i am stuck. What people don't know is i tried a third time and the only reason i am alive is because i choose to for my own reasons. Suicide is an option that i could take when at any point things go downhill too much.

344359,"JESUS CAN HELP YOU I PROMISE!!!As a kid, I used to love playing video games and my passion and the fun i got out of them just went away more and more until i felt nothing. It was just an escape for me and i had stayed my visit. I felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders and like i would never be enough for my family. After moving away from all of my friends i started getting more and more depressed. I beat myself and cut and when i couldnt cut at school i would use a rubber band to snap at my wrists in the bathroom. I had no idea where my life was going or what i was supposed to do to get out of this. I was so depressed i couldnt even get out of bed. So, one day i was scrolling through YouTube and saw a video about this guy talking about Jesus to people on the street and what He could do for them and how He could tranform their lives and i said to myself mehhhh idk man thats just silly. I couldn't admit to myself at that point but i actually loved the pain. It was like it felt good to be depressed, like it was the one thing i could own and it was mine. But i got to watching more and more videos and one day i said what the heck, ill ya a try God. Since then God has changed my life day by day and Hes given me back my childlike excitement and enjoyment of life. He took away my depression and i literally feel like a person. You might not believe He can do those things, and thats okay, but im asking you to just take a chance like i did. I promise you Jesus will transform your life. But, why? Why would He do that? Because, He loves you. He loves you so, so much He died for you on cross so you could be forgiven and wouldnt have to feel that way and you could have a relationship with God. All you have to do to recieve Jesus is confess your sins, turn from them, and ask God to come into your life. And maybe you don't believe in God, but please at least take a chance on Him. Ask Him to reveal himself to you in your life and show you some sign or feeling that He is there and if you believe He will do so I promise you He will God is a good God and He loves you very very much! If you want to ask God for forgiveness and healing please say these prayers and even if you don't believe in God or it feels silly please give God a chance! Just fold your hands, bow your head and say these words: 

Prayer for forigveness - Dear Lord, I admit that I am a sinner. I have done many things that don’t please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry, and I repent. I ask you to forgive me. I believe that you died on the cross for me, to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you and in a way that pleases you. I love you, Lord, and I thank you that I will spend all eternity with
you. Amen.

Prayer for God to give you peace - Heavenly Father, I am in need of Your strength right now. It’s a very tough time for me, and I don’t know if I could go on any further. Problem after problem is attacking me from all directions. I can no longer depend on my own power to overcome these challenges. They have become too much for me. Which is why I’m coming to You today. Father God, I trust that You are in control of my life at all times. Calm my heart, God, and keep it away from the spirit of fear and anxiety. You are the only one who can comfort me now. Surround me with Your peace that surpasses all understanding. Raise me up in Your victorious right hand. Walk with me through these challenges that I am going through. Grant me Your strength, God, that I may not give up even if the going gets tough. Help me, God, to focus on You and not on my problems. I know that You, God, are bigger than all of those problems combined. If I put my trust in You, I will never be disappointed. If I wait on You, I will never grow weary. Enable me, God, to have patience and to fully depend on You for strength, that I may soar on wings like eagles. And now, God, I surrender to you my heavy burdens: the challenges, the problems, the obstacles in my life right now. Take them, God, and carry them. Whenever You are with me, I know that I don’t have to bear the load alone. Likewise, I surrender the outcomes of my challenges to You, Father. Only You are in control of what will happen next. As I face those giants, help me to make the right decisions. Grant me peace of mind too as I leave the results up to You. As each problem is solved and each obstacle is hurdled, grant me rest, Father God. Allow me to recover after these tough days. Enable me to enjoy Your presence afterwards, as well as the presence of the people I am within this journey called life. All these I ask in Your Name, Amen.

I pray that you will find God and He will change your life like He did mine. Never forget what He did for you and how much HE LOVES YOU!!❤🙏✝️",depression

I keep thinking about my little cousins and nieces and nephews.... and I know some of them are suicidal, I’m someone they look up to.

My husband is a cop, so he has been seeing these things for awhile.... but lately he’s become secretive and kind of..... not there. He is the only one who knows about my depression, I put a really really good face on for everyone else.

We’ve been married for a long time, and all of the sudden it’s like he doesn’t even care when I become depressed. It makes me feel selfish like my depression is just for attention, and it makes me feel guilty and even more depressed.

I was verbally and sexually abused by my parents growing up and it really left a lot of scars on me. Even though I thought I had heated from them they’re all coming back.
What they did makes me hate myself, they always told me I was a burden. Told me no one would love me because I was disgusting.

I felt bad at first (even though my car is fucked and his just had a dent) but then he flipped out like I had intentionally decided to run into him or something.

Tired of being a failure.
Tired of screwing up everything I touch.

I'm tired of the mood swings and the anxiety and the fits of rage that come out of absolutely nowhere for the littlest things. It's the accumulation that does it. It builds up and builds till it explodes.

I have a routine and an active lifestyle. I go to.school and work and force myself to go to the gym daily. I have a car and an apartment and food in the fridge and my cats are happy and healthy. I have a social life, I have friends, I have everything you would need to make a normal person content with the situation.

198281,"I have attempted in the past. I visualize often.Every morning I wake up and visualize suicide. Not as bad when I had a specific plan but escalating.
. I was with a person for 18 years who throughout the relationship was both verbally and physically abusive. I will make very clear that I did struggle with alcohol use during this time, as a self medicating escape of the reality I lived in. Also I used alcohol to escape the depression.

About 2 years I ago.I suffered a slip and fall accident that left me disabled for life.

I am a computer network architect. I am quite good at what I do. I am paid well for it,

Throughout our relationship my partner either attended school or attempted to hold a job. While she was sucessful at school, she was unable to hold a job and was fired frequently.

At present she has moved in with a gentleman across the street and our son is living there. Frequently I am either threatened with violence and or watched coming and going. Visitors are monitored. I know that sounds paranoid, but it is not. And there lies the big issue. My mental health issues are frequently used as a defence against any and everything I say.

Our son is 16. Throughout his life I was his main caregiver. My partner was involved in multiple affairs and would not been present on weekends or for long extended periods. In fact, when she was home and unemployed, I worked and cooked dinner and shopped for the family until my accident.

About six months ago, when I recognized that she was about to have another affair, I told her not to return. After this I became very depressed and did text her expressing my depression. She took this  to the police and claimed criminal harassment .I was not charged, I was simply phoned by the officer and asked to cease communication.

Now we get to the issue and problem that I have. You see the above paragraph and her actions, that is calling the police and or threatening to has been core to our relationship.

I am six foot two and about 210. She is about 100 pounds or more as she has recently gained weight. This has negated any and all of my pleas for help during and even after our relationship ended.

For example, I underwent a second operation, after becoming disabled, on my ankle. I returned home shortly after. That night an argument over money began. That is, in my disabled state I was not providing enough. I was trying to make my way up the stairs in our house, she pinned my ankle against the stair with one boot and delivered a deliberate kick to my ankle. This caused massive pain and I was vocal.

This caused the police to attend for a disturbance call. She voiced to the officers that I was the issue as I had not been providing enough money. The officer did express disbelief at her statement and pointed out I was incapacitated. This refusal by  the officer to not sympathize with her, did not bode well for me. I expressed to one to the officers that I was being abused and asked for help. He responded that this was a disturbance call and he could do nothing. She was allowed to stay in the house. Later that night a knife was held to my throat for almost 30 minutes while she ranted about the police and how I had embarressed her.  I attended hospital the next day so there are records regarding this.

The knife to the throat and or body was a common occurence. I have told the police this. Also used are keywords. That is words or phrases that are known to inflict mental distress. Often, when used these words will put me into a manic state where I may text a response as I find it hard to verbally communicate my responses.

If you understood that last sentence then, you may understand how  I was first threatened with harrassment. As she understands that I cannot respond verbally personal visits are made. Often these begin with an expression of concern, then almost everytime, the words and or phrases are used.

It is getting worse.

Here’s the deal. I am a senior in high school and am addicted to cannabis. For the past few months I have been stealing weed from my parents. I am a fucking idiot and obviously they found out, and I denied it. 

My parents started wondering what was going on and blamed my friends. I stayed silent on the issue, yet I kept stealing.

Today my parents sat me down to tell me that my shitty, manipulative, toxic, lie-filled jig is up. They were almost on the verge of tears as I admitted to stealing and lying and being a worthless piece of shit. Seeing my mom cry as she told me she felt like she couldn’t trust me completely tore me apart.

    Basically when I was a kid I was extremely enthusiastic and loved life much like any other kid I guess. Shit took a drastic change after I got in like 1st or 2nd grade. I was bigger than a lot of the kids. My dad was an amazing cook and I was always eating. I was bullied every. Single. Day. About my weight and how I looked. The funny thing is...the people bullying me were my friends. I hung out with them outside of school and shit like that. Every single moment I was with them they were making fun of me and shit. I was their verbal punching bag. They all had pretty bad family problems. (Didn’t know that till I was a bit older.) Anyways, that went on for a pretty long time. All of elementary school, actually. It never really got to me though. Yeah, it hurt but I just always thought of it as a joke because idk. I wasn’t really a person who took shit to heart back then. I genuinely loved life. So going into middle school...I made new friends. I was always the funny one people went to when they were feeling down, etc. After that, I started making fun of myself to make other people laugh. I became extremely popular throughout my town or whatever. I was attractive, funny, and had a lot of friends. The thing is...I tried so hard to make other people happy. I never EVER thought about myself now that I think of it. My “best friends” continued to make fun of me...how I looked, how I ate, literally every possible aspect of my life. It was mostly only one of them, the other 2 I could actually call my best friends. Idk. Back to the point. On to high school. Freshman year, I started to think about myself and thought “what do I want? I started being rude as fuck to everyone. Teachers, my “friends”...anyone who said shit about me or pissed me off I guess. That’s basically when I realized I was depressed as fuck from all this shit I’ve been putting up with since fucking elementary school. I also have OCD. I remember having symptoms since I can even remember. So I’ve been dealing with that too. Anyways...I made even more friends, and lost all the old ones. I was a jock, played football...shit like that. After I stopped taking people’s shit I started getting into drugs, fighting, and doing anything illegal I could possibly think of. Anyways, Onto about sophomore/junior year I dropped out. I hated school &amp; everything about it. I had a job or whatever (still work there today) and I was fine with my decision because I honestly fucking hated school. (At the time) and couldn’t give a fuck about anyone there. I stopped talking to literally everyone except for probably 1 person. That’s when the depression, anxiety, and ocd took over my life. I hated everything. I hated my life. All I would do was sit in bed, watch Netflix, listen to music, and go to work. Literally. Every fucking day. I never saw my family, (except my parents and siblings...) never went out, never did shit. I was basically rotting in my bed. After my family saw the shit I was going through I was hospitalized twice in a psych hospital and went to therapy, got on medication, and everything was still the same. The only times I got up was to go to mcdonald’s, smoke, or go to the bathroom or whatever. Like I was talking about earlier...I was a big kid. I had a lot of extra weight but at this point I was a stick. Idk how, Probably just my metabolism. Anyways fast forward to now. It’s still the same. Never got my ged. Still have the same fast food job. I’m 21...I dropped out when I was 16. 5 years of the same shit. When I was a kid I had so many dreams...I wanted to be so many things. I always talked to my friends in middle school about going to college, graduating, and how our lives would be after school. It’s crazy to think I would end up here. If you wanna know how severe/fucked up my OCD is, look at my other post. I can’t even bear talking about that shit again. My life is shit. There’s nothing ANYONE can say to make me feel better about myself. There’s nothing ANYONE can say to make me wanna live. I’m the definition of a trashy ass mother fucker with no life and there’s nothing anyone can say to change my mind. Shit...if anyone’s even reading this they’re probably thinking “why hasn’t he killed himself yet” i don’t even fucking know. This will probably be my last post. I don’t deserve happiness. I don’t deserve anything tbh. Whenever i think of myself doing something fun or something good for myself i cringe. Whenever i eat i hate myself, because i feel like someone else more deserving could be eating that instead of fucking ME. I literally lose 5-10 pounds a month. (If you wanna know why, again, go to my recent OCD related post. As I’m sitting here I’m actually planning when I’m going to “catch the bus”. I’ve planned this about a thousand times but never really thought of when i was going to do it. I’m sure now. If this post made anyone else feel better...well I’m actually glad. I hope someone read this and was like “damn my life actually isn’t that bad”. Or something like that. Well, that’s really it. Bye everyone. ",depression

I'm not some sparring bag, where you can consistently make everyone catch me with my pants down. This is what you have done to me dude, this is how I always feel, because of you. You don't know me, you've created your own character and attached it to me, he made me some imaginary character, and all the things he attached to that character, he told everyone but me about, essentially making sure no one would want to talk to me. I endured this until the end of high school really. You know what the sad thing is? I really did try being his friend, I fucking did, but every time I was there, he shot me down by humiliating me in public. It got terrible in high school, everyone started following off him, including people I was in class with alllll day. They were my friends I think, I really have no idea. They were cool to me not much of the time, alot of the time they would be a my friend at a tuck shop, or if no one else was in that class that day if they weren't there. Except for jonah, jonah was fuucken cool with me, although if he was outside with all the others he would just do the same and ridicule me. Anyways, if I see it my everyone else's eyes, I am a fucken loner, no one out of my small friends circle actually gives a shit about me, I'm a outcast. Girls don't find me attractive, the only friends I have are ones I shared a lot in common with. It's confusing how it happened though. I knew Doral for quite a while before I became friends with him. He we went to the same vurch both since we were young, we eventually clicked in the 8th grade when we both went for drum auditions, I think they let both if us play once or something, but neither of us really got a full on callback.

And whatever this thing is that I have depression or whatever the fuck it is tainted the one good relationship I had which was with my dad but what we had is gone because I just don't even recognize myself and I'm somebody who I don't even think is me and I lash out and say things I don't mean. The friends I've managed to gain back I don't even have a relationship with them I never talk to them I just don't have the energy and I just don't know how without feeling like a burden or like they're talking to me out of pity. 

I just feel like I'm on life support everybody's just waiting for me to go they know it's inevitable. I just feel too far gone like I'm never going to be healthy again I'm always going to have this depression and anxiety and feel like I'm worthless. It's like everyone around me is just trying to make it easier for me to go. Like when you stop taking chemo because the cancer has taken over so you choose to have a better quality life over a longer sicker life. They're just trying to ease the pain until I kill myself because thy all know there's no hope for me.

And I've faought with everybody in my life I havnt not faought with anybody even though I try so hard not to lose anybody they all end up leaving. And every time I get in a fight I just hear her voice saying nobody loves you. And I try so hard to be liked by everybody I just want to get along with everybody but I can't something always happens and we fight and it's my fault. I just don't know how to have a normal relationship with anybody. I want to kill myself and I havnt thought about that seriously since I lived with her. I just feel like a burden to everybody like I'm just in their way and causing pain and destruction. 

I can't do this anymore. I don't even know who I am I don't feel like anybody else knows either I'm just here kind of taking up space like I should have killed myself years ago like everything is wrong and I need to be dead for things to be set right again. I havnt done anything good for anybody and they all know how far gone I am and that there's no hope for me that's why nobody says anything.

214937,"I think I've given up now.I've suffered from depression and suicidal ideation for fifteen years now. This recent episode has been particularly painful. I had been well for three years prior.

I feel as though I don't know what to do. Actually, to be more precise, I feel I have no other choice but to kill myself. It's odd, because in truth I have a few options available to me that could help alleviate the pain. But I just feel so... ashamed. I'm so embarrassed by who I am. I hate myself, I always have, and a few negative comments--last week from a man I was seeing, today from my mother--have affirmed all of the reasons I think I am so awful. I am so upset over every last mistake I have ever made. I think I am so disgusting, so repulsive. I want to erase myself from existence. 

I wonder who I would have been without this disorder, what I could have done. I think of all the people I've lost during my episodes, people I've pushed away or who otherwise walked away. I wouldn't want to be friends with me, either. I wouldn't want to date me. 

My life seems to be improving, professionally and socially, and my utter inability to appreciate it is how I know it's time. I worked very hard to put myself in a place where I felt I could be happy. I am close to that place. I'm not happy.

I felt well last summer. My anxiety was horrible, but I was in no way depressed. I may have never been happier, actually. I had a job I enjoyed, a prospective career change about which I was incredibly excited, a man I was beginning to love. But it unravelled in the fall, and I along with it. I haven't been able to right myself since. Nearly six months now. My mother says I'm just using my depression as an excuse. She says I'm being immature, that it's drama and histrionics. She's cited the same reason that had encouraged me to first plan to kill myself all those years ago: this is my fault. I am stupid and annoying and unlovable. I hurt everyone with my sadness. I'm just weak, and pathetic. 

I should try harder to get well. But for what? To live a few more years, maybe good ones, maybe bad, only to have another debilitating depressive episode? This is the kind of life I can look forward to. Who would opt in for that?

I've been staying alive for my family. Twelve years now, since my initial suicide attempt. But I can't live this way anymore. I cannot sit here, suffering, alone, alive only because it would grieve my family and friends. They are asking too much of me. I've stayed here as long as I could. If they really love me, they'll see that when they find out that I've finally done it. They'll understand that it always had to be this way.

I’ve chosen to go into the sea, I know it will be painful but not for long. 
I found this extract from quora which enforces this decision to get into the sea. 
And before anyone says just get a gun, I can’t. I live in the U.K. and I have a history of mental health which would mean I’ll never be able to get a license. And other means I would definitely back out on. The sea, I can’t really back out on as once I’m there being a 90 pound girl I’ll never have the strength to swim for long. 
Anyway here’s that extract;

your survival instincts kick in making you breathe involuntarily. when this happens it isn't painful (at least not after the 1st or 2nd breath), you are able to actually take a few breaths of water before you die. This process is relatively peaceful, you have a strong feeling of being tired. You just want to sleep but this is the sleep you will not awake form.
if you somehow get saved the consequences are horrible. You can damage multiple parts of your brain making you restricted to doing certain tasks…
personally, this is how I want to go, it's calming and feels like you are just falling asleep. This whole process can take about 7–10 minutes if you aren't skilled in holding your breath like me.
after you sink from the intake of water making you heavier, you look up from the dark abyss and it has a certain beauty especially if the moon is visible. you are put into a dream like state. Soon your whole life flashes before your eyes and then you let that strong urge to sleep take over.
I hope you won't commit suicide but it's your choice (if thats what this is about…)

As it says. I hope others won’t follow this, I know my time is up. I can sense it. This whole year. 
But that doesn’t mean yours is. Please reach out to someone.

It feels like holding my breath for 5 years. I just can't visualise where the heck am I going to find the strength to do it. I can barely take one more week of this, let alone several years.

118404,"I'm uniquely fucked up and I'm genuinely backed into a corner.Almost 17, I'm that damn young and I've been like this for ten years, they feel so long and so short at the same time
I've been suicidally depressed since I was 7, I've talked myself down multiple times, my memory isn't great but as far as I can remember, I first started to have psychotic symptoms at the age of 15, I'd been having huge mood swings from depressive to pretty happy I think, I'd want to do certain things and be fairly productive, recently these mood swings are from complete despair to slight depression yet somewhat productive and outgoing.
Anyway, at the age of 15 my depression got even worse, I went out on night time walks and almost killed myself multiple times, I started to have delusions and I started to see and hear things, I had extreme paranoia, so much so that one time I duct-taped some soda cans to string and then taped those to the ceiling above my door so that while I was elsewhere in the house I'd know if someone broke into my room to hack my computer.
I started developing all kinds of delusions, ranging from the idea that I'd been poisoned with some kind of virus or disease to there being holes in the sky, I'd lost it.
I started to self-harm, one time I went outside and decided to bring my knife with me (which was illegal to have outside) I went to an abandoned park and sat down on a bench in the middle of the forest, shrouded in darkness, I cut for a while and then stood up eventually.
That's when I heard it, branches rustling, cracking, they started going crazy, as if something was sprinting through them, and then I saw IT, I didn't quite realize what it was then as I ran way before getting a good look at it but I'd soon see it again and again, it's a figure that's darker than the darkness around it, like a hole in space, it's the same height and build as me, it wears that same hoodie and cargo pants, it's dressed exactly like me, it IS me, it's some kind of dark version of myself, that's how fucking insane I am, I hallucinate a dark double of myself! Sounds like something from a movie or game right? I mean, I've looked this shit up, nobody has experienced anything like this and reported it.
One time the walls closed in on me, another I heard the sounds of some hellish dog right behind me, I had all kinds of insane hallucinations, I heard voices, faint but definitely there. I'd hear singing downstairs, I'd descend the stairs and it'd stop, nobody in the house would've heard it.

I came close to ending my life so many times, especially during that break when I was 15.

I tried to seek help but long story short I can't anymore, just please believe me on this, I can't get help, alright? Atleast just pretend I'm right or don't post, I can't get help for a multitude of reasons.
My paranoia had gotten really bad, I thought the government was after me I think, I dunno, it's kinda foggy.
I slowly got better, I still wanted to die and I still felt depressed but I found myself my purpose, my reason for being here, I followed it and then I failed, I just stayed in my room even more, stopped going out on walks even, I've been descending into the rabbit hole again, while I've been fighting off delusions with not too much trouble (Although I think I may have had one a month ago, only took me a couple weeks to snap out of it though, it being the first one in a good while to take a hold of me slightly and it was based on something slightly logical) 
I had a nightmare a few months ago and IT was there, I was scared as it'd never invaded my nightmares before, I started hallucinating again and my depression got even worse, I've started self harming again and my hallucinations are coming back, I spent Christmas eve outside in the dark and the cold wandering the streets alone, debating suicide.
I'm alone, always have been really, I've been drinking to cope with things, I keep hoping it'll leave me foolish enough to kill myself, I've been cutting again and it's worse than ever.

I honestly feel like a fraud, like I'm lying or exaggerating all of this for attention when I know I'm not, I don't want attention, I don't even know why I'm posting this.
Most of the people on here don't want to die, if their life got better that'd fix things, they want things to get better but they just don't see another way out other than suicide.
I want to die, I don't want things to improve, I want to die, I think I've grown attatched to my depression for some insane reason, the emotional pain is genuinely like torture, I can hardly distract myself anymore, each day is just hell, I want to fucking die, I genuinely have no reason to keep going but I keep having this part of me that keeps trying to crawl forward, to keep fighting, I don't know why I still fight.
I don't think I can fight the psychotic symptoms anymore, and especially not the depression, I can't take it anymore, I really feel like I've had my fill.
When I was 15 and had that first psychotic break I used to wander the streets and just stare down groups of thugs (I live in a shitty area) I wanted them to kill me, I was hoping glaring at their leader would make them try to stab me or something yet they fucking don't, they always looked away and ignored me, they seemed scared, I'm only 6'2! Seriously, I was like 6'0-6'1 when I was 15, why the hell would they be afraid of me!? 
I can't stand seeing IT and I know that I will see IT again and I fucking can't deal with that, I can't deal with the hallucinations and I worry the delusions will grab me again, that delusion I may have had a month-ish ago I don't think was one, but I may be lying to myself, I mean, I thought someone was stalking me, I thought someone was after me, all because I saw the same red car a few times, all because he/she stuck their hand out of the window and did some kind of wave at me, it was near christmas, they were probably just saying hello or something.
I'm losing my mind, I can't take this shit anymore, I'm homeschooled but I've been not doing anything for a long time, I can't fucking take this shit anymore.

I'm gonna drink a few more shots of vodka, self-harm some more and maybe take some pills (not a lethal amount, just enough to fuck me up without hospitalizing me) I don't know why I wanna do damage to myself.

I thought I'd gotten past all this, I knew I was still depressed but I genuinely thought I was past this.

I've been drinking, I don't know how much I've left out, I know I've atleast not said half of the shit that's wrong with me (Oh yeah, I'm serious) 

I don't think I'm bipolar or schizophrenic, I'm nowhere near that bad right? I mean, I'd have constant hallucinations, not just a few a week or something. I mean, I guess I could have bipolar or schizoaffective or something but as I said, I don't think I'm hallucinating enough for that and my ""up"" phases aren't exactly manic, but what do I know? 

I genuinely can't get help, believe me on that, even if you don't, pretend you do. I'm debating killing myself in a couple weeks or a few days or whatever, I dunno, I really don't, I have nothing and nobody to live for and I've been doing this dance ten fucking years, I'm sick of talking myself out of it, what kind of seven year old is suicidal!? Anyway, I can't fucking take it anymore. 


TLDR: 16 years old, almost 17, been suicidally depressed for 10 years with mood swings, has hallucinations and sometimes delusions, I see a dark version of myself that stalks me around and I've been drinking and self-harming, I've been self harming a while though.

It made me feel very relaxed and calm, more then I've ever been in 3+ years. Well there was no actual treatment, just making sure I didn't hurt myself.

Now I'm home, I got discharged dispise saying I was ready. And here I am again, planning my suicide. My problems not only control me, but run and ruin my entire life, and I'm past the point of help. Been on 4 anti depressants, seen 2 councillors; one for 3 years, as well as seeing doctors, specialists, trying to eat and sleep better, exercise more. But nothing, fucking, helps. 

Saying I'm serendipitous would be putting it lightly. I'm the most sensitive person Ive ever need anywhere. My best friend makes a joke about my favourite band? That upset me. Someone has constructive criticism for me when I ask how I look/sound? Well there goes my self esteem and confidence.

I know that my life will be just living off of disability and welfare **if** I can even get it. I won't get proper justice for the person who fucked me up as a baby and made me this way. I'll never have love, I'm a fucking mess in a relationship. I'll never keep friends for more then a few years, my emotions are too much for them to deal with. The only people who *I guess* stick by me are my close family, but that becquse they have to. They know it's horrible to even think about not wanting to have/deal with your mentally ill daughter. I've reached such a low of mental health that I don't even know what I want anymore. Am I actually who i think I am? Do I ever want to eat? What type of person do I wanna date?  What am I okay with, and not okay with? I can't fucking tell at this point.

I'm trying to come up with a new suicide plan so it's quick, 99% to work, painless, but this time, *looks like an accident.* I'll probably start writing my note soon.

39714,"i need helpyou stared calling me a rapist and asking what the fuck happened after i was clearly drunk.  i didn't know how to respond so i did the best i could. i tried to explain what actually happened, then how i happened and then i was attacked, physically mentally and morally, in order to break my spirit and my life.  fuck the world... what does it matter if i live or die... absolulelty none... especially if, where i thnink i do good I'm a total ass hole.. FUCK MY LIFE

some people say be happy, but you know what?  fuck that happiness is total bullshit and is only attained through complete and total individual sacrifice even though there was no possible way that sex was actually an option, as we aren't fucking biblicle fuck machines; oh wait we are... 

so, after spending a night making sure that nobody get's raped or seduced in a indecent way, I've learned that it doesn't fucking matter and you will be accused of rape no matter what happens; even if it is your one absolute goal to keep girls from rape and you fulfull that goal.  Girls are ass holes and will accuse anyone of anything..

But, I think of how stupid the average person is and I realize that half of humanity is less intelligent. To be truthfull, this makes me die a little inside to know the idiocy of our race

I only look for the good in our race however hard it is to find and in return, our individuals accuse and fuck without thought or reason, simply to provide blame on those deemeed unnecessary",depression

Feelings of loneliness and self-loathing have gotten to a really bad point and I feel like it's my only option. I've tried being a good person and to be kind to others, thinking it will make me feel better. Unfortunately it doesn't. No matter what I've done or who I help out, I will never see myself as good. I will never feel like I did good enough in school or in life. To put it simply, I absolutely hate myself and I think other people dislike me as well. 

The only thing I see in the cards for me is a future of scrambling to build my reputation in the corporate world, living alone in an apartment with very little sleep and company/friends. This idea scares the living shit out of me and I am less than 2 years away from this reality.

The only thing keeping me somewhat in check is going to the gym and video games, but those are giving back diminishing returns now. 

I'm going to write some letters to friends, family, etc to explain that it isn't their fault. Hopefully this won't be too big of a hassle for my roommates, I'm pretty replaceable.

But. 

I don’t know why. It just happens at night sometimes, and it happens more frequently now. I’ve never gotten into fights with my grandma but recently I’ve had 2. I get agitated easily. I’ve had periods of just getting extremely pessimistic about myself, and I just, cry. I don’t know why

So, I feel like I'll end up alone. The only romantic relationship I've had was with a girl who I though was the love of my life. She made me happy, she made me feel good about myself. I was considering marrying this girl. However, I had a massive mental breakdown at some point, and I started opening up about my past, and the fact that I have depression. I told her that I want to end my own life once in a while and she said to me ""Okay, Anon (I'd prefer to not have my name out here), you scare me."". I felt fine for a while about her since I apologised for acting weird.

 However 1 month later she is not responding to my text messages or calls at all and seems to have gone silent, 2 weeks after that she responds to me saying that she has been cheating on me for 1 month... It broke my heart and I went on an episode of smoking, doing drugs and drinking, and now I feel empty. The one girl that made me happy... gone. I'm way too shy to talk to anyone outside my close friend group due to my social anxiety and my depression makes me feel like I'm a worthless piece of garbage that doesn't deserve love. I'm fairly certain that I'll end up on the streets with nothing to my name and no one that cares about me.

25587,"My Note. Its been running since the end of march. Kind of a journal into why im going to eventually kill myself.21 years is 10 years too long to live like this. I've decided to let my depression take its course. I've fought this as long as I could for your sake and I'm spent. Hopefully my life has had some positive effect on yours. I love you all and thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love, friendship, and support. I will see you someday in Heaven. I love you.

You keep pulling me closer, forcing me to be a part of your lives, temporaraly putting off what will be, what has to be. I am most anxious about what my suicide will do to you. Eventually I'm going to implode and I don't want you hurt by my death. Excuse me if I try to limit your proximity.

I have wanted to die for as long as I can remember. I've made some half-assed attempts, I guess knowing the pain it would bring to those close to me prevented me from actualy doing anything. I'm close to so many people and I hate myself for the impact this will have on you. I've put on a show for so many people. Not a good one admitably but a show none-the-less. I'm counting on a stroke or heart attack to do what I cannot. Or atleast a life miserable enough to drive me to it. I'm on my meds and seeing a therapist yet these same feelings come around. I know I can never be happy. God still yet has a plan for me and that's okay. I just pray He takes me soon. If I do die by my own hand know I loved you all a great deal. Nikki, for never waivering and fighting for me til the end. Travis for being a constant pillar and anchor for me. To the both of you, I'm sorry I was never the friend you deserved. I died knowing you two will be okay. To everyone else; I never let you in far enough. Please don't blame yourselves for this, you all had the right intentions. The truth, the ugly, evil truth is that no one but God can stop me (or anyone) from doing this in the long run. This was no one's fault, it had to happen, I have no future with this disease it will get me whether directly or through a life of apathy and risk. This was no one's fault. 
I want so much to find peace. I want this pain I cause myself to end. I've fought it so long so that I wouldn't hurt the people who love me but I can't do it anymore. There's nothing my friends and family didn't do to help me. That means so much to me and has put this off for so long. But to live I have to want to live and now the pain is just too great to deal with. Heaven will bring me peace. Peace in God's prescence. I'll be free from sin and the evil that infects this world. I'll be free from my disease. If I don't do this, I'll be a lifeless husk burdening everyone I love with my pain and negativity. You all deserve so much more. You deserve a life free from me. I know this seperation will be hard, I want to prevent it but a lifetime with me dragging you all down is just as bad. Let me rip this leech of a life off of you. 

Nikki- You're on the right track. I love you to the bottom of my heart. Please forgive me.
Travis- You are a prophet and an encourager. Stay awsome.
Corrin- Youve made a wonderful life for yourself. That sweet girl and wonderful baby love you, i know you're the man for the job
Mom- I'm relieving you of this burden. You've done so much and all you can. I'm in heaven now. I'm at peace.
Dad- It's been a privilege to be your son.
Alex- No matter what you do with your life, I'm proud of you. You are a wonderful man.
Everyone- Take care of eachother. I'll see you later.

There will be pain, but much less for us both. I love you all. Know I am at peace.

I feel numb anymore. All these same thoughts go through my mind and i feel paralyzed by them. I think I'm going to kill myself soon. My wish is that you all keep on. My life is already a failure. I'm already not who I'm supposed be. Just please let me go. I have all this pain inside and I just can't go on like this. It won't come out. Depression has always been like digging yourself a hole and then waking up suddenly and realizing theres no hole and you're okay. But that hasn't happened in a long time. I'm really starting to think that the hole is real. And even worse im seeing the dirt ive been throwing on my friends all this time. I wish i could disappear from your lives...like the ending to a good book. I wish i could live happily ever after but that wont happen. It has to be this way and soon before this onetime truckload of dirt is more than the life time of dirt i will throw on you if i dont die now.   

Im slipping back into a depression again. I dont have any prospects and I cant be an aid the rest of my life. Whos going to marry a depressed, fat, loser? I dont blame anyone, im not willing to improve myself. We all die. Im just getting it over with sooner

I cant keep this up anymore...its 747pm on sunday 5/27. Ive kept this as a running note since november or december. I intend to take my double barrel into the stand of hickories where I hunt and sit beneath a big tree. Ill polish off a bottle of whiskey, call nikki to tell her i love her, set a timed text to inform Pstr. Bob of my location and death asking him to call the sherriff so that they can pick up my body. Im hoping to save anyone I care for from scraping me off a tree. If I were to talk to anyone now they would surely hospitalize me and I would be left incapable of killing myself in such a painless fashion for the rest life  of my life, a chance I cannot take. Im so very sorry youre all included in my life. I blame myself for that. It was selfish of me to maintain friends knowing my life would some day end this way. Until I see you in heaven, goodbye.

My trip has failed to give me perspective. Im only more depressed and distant than I ever have been. Its time to do this. Ive fucked you all over so much. Love eachother. Please.

I really need to do this. I cant imagine living another day and i cant do it anymore. I just want to die. I wish i could quietly disappear but thats impossible. Im sorry ive put this off for so long. Ive been selfish to put you all through the burden of having me around.

I finally feel peace about my suicide.

Ill be totally free today. Ive seen everyone ive wanted this week. Ill call some friends who are around the country, ill visit a couple people. And tonight im gonna do it. Ill kill myself. Trearted for this 5 times, hospitalized three times. I dont want help, i dont want to live. I dont care if ill be happy again. This is only temporary if i seek help, which isnt going to happen. Thats my line in the sand. Im going to die by my own hand. Its the best thing for everyone.

Im trying to make things easier on all of you. Im not mad at anyone. Youve all done so much to help me. I know how much you love me and i hope you know how much i love you. This seems so selfish but please dont think im doing this lightly. I can remember thinking about suicide in the 4th grade. This is deep deep deep inside of me. Ive fought uphill everyday of my life for you. I dont think ive really lived for or loved myself. But i wouldnt trade any of you for anything. Its been my honor to shoulder this burden but its to a point where its hurting everyone around me. Please believe me when i say i love you. I truly do. Thats why im doing this for you. Im very scared. Dieing scares me me. But not as much as hurting the people i love. Not as much as going back to a hospital. Im working up to it. I can do this.",depression

Don't get me wrong I'm not really depressed like everyone else here, I just don't understand the point of living. My whole life I haven't exactly been sad or ever that happy. I gain no joy from my friends, or any hobbies or anything else. Life is just a lot of work honestly. I don't want to go to college. I don't want to get a job. I don't want to do this and that in my life because I have to. Its all tedious, constant work. Where is the enjoyment?

Shouldn't we be alive to enjoy our short time here not spend it doing things we hate that won't matter in 60~ years from now. I don't see death as a depressing thing that you SHOULDN'T do. Some will say ""Oh no you have so much to experience still."" First off bullshit. Second, who cares, once I'm dead I won't care that I didn't experience any of it.

All though I feel I might as well stay alive so as to get a girlfriend at some point. That may be interesting for a short time. Although I've never had any cravings for social interaction. And like I said earlier once I'm dead it won't matter what I have and haven't done. 

I just want to be in a state of none living, but that would make my family, especially my mother, sad so I don't want to do that to her. BUT If I do do it. I'd want to do something funny or cool on my way out, Any ideas?

64554,"Why I never want to be famous, or be a celebrity. Yearning to be famous when you’re a kid is normal. Hell, I was even so obsessed of being a famous youtuber back then I actually pretended to voice videos in the shower. Those were a fun few years.

Anyway as I eventually matured and became older, I kind of switched my views on things regarding popularity. One of the reasons for my change on popularity is the fact that it will put an insane amount of pressure on my mental health. Say if I was a celeb (as unlikely as it could happen), and I get social media. All those likes and constant notifications of people commenting and all that. It kinda gets to you. For people who are supportive, it just feels as if I would be pressured to do more and more of the stuff I did. I’m afraid if I continue that, I would spend all my time on whatever it is I’m known for and not on other things, like myself. 

Well what if I just don’t create an account on social media? This brings me to my other point: getting recognized irl. I was never really good with conversation, nor was I good at talking in general. My fear is that I would say something that people don’t like and I wouldn’t even know about it. My words would have heavier weight both outside social media and in. And if I do say something that people do not like without my knowing of it, the fear of being canceled just really gets to me. 

I’d rather just live a more quiet, and private life. Most likely as a history teacher or historian and have a YouTube channel on the side as a hobby. But I don’t know, maybe I am just being a bit too over-cautious or scared.",non-depression

People pretend to care about you when they know you're depressed and considering ending your life because you are insecure, self-loathing, etc. etc.... but if the first thing they learned about you was one of the problems that is causing your self-loathing, they would have no problem admitting that they view you as a pathetic person (especially if they can remain anonymous in doing so).

Example:

My worst fear is rejection and due to my low self-esteem, I have this idea in the back of my head that someone would think I'm creepy if I complimented their looks, so I never flirt with (or even talk to) anyone, which causes an unbelievable amount of loneliness and emptiness.
